## Abstract

The Reward module provides the base reward system for a blockchain developed with the Lisk SDK. In this LIP, we specify the protocol logic that this module injects during the block lifecycle as well as the functions that can be called from off-chain services.

## Copyright

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal][creative].

## Motivation

The goal of this LIP is to modularize the rewards assignment logic when a new block is generated. For this purpose, we specify the Reward module, which will make it easier to customize this logic and replace it if necessary.

## Rationale

The Reward module induces specific logic after the application of a block:

* After applying the block, a certain quantity of the native token of the blockchain is minted and assigned to the block generator. The exact amount assigned to the block generator, i.e., the reward, is calculated depending on the rules of the [Random module][random-module] and the property `impliesMaxPrevotes` of the [block header][block-schema-lip].

## Specification

In this section, we specify the protocol logic in the lifecycle of a block injected by the Reward module as well as the functions that can be called from off-chain services. It depends on the token and random modules.

### Types

| **Name**    | **Type** | **Validation**                   | **Description**        |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| BlockHeader | object   | see [LIP 0055][block-schema-lip] | The header of a block. |
| Block       | object   | see [LIP 0055][block-schema-lip] | The block object.      |

### Constants

| **Name**                        | **Type** | **Value**                                 |
|---------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `MODULE_NAME_REWARD `           | string   | "reward"                                  |
| `EVENT_NAME_REWARD_MINTED`      | string   | "rewardMinted"                            |
| `REWARD_NO_REDUCTION`           | uint32   | 0                                         |
| `REWARD_REDUCTION_SEED_REVEAL`  | uint32   | 1                                         |
| `REWARD_REDUCTION_MAX_PREVOTES` | uint32   | 2                                         |
| `REWARD_REDUCTION_NO_ACCOUNT`   | uint32   | 3                                         | 
| `TOKEN_ID_REWARD`               | bytes    | specified as part of module configuration |
| `REWARD_REDUCTION_FACTOR_BFT`   | uint32   | 4                                         |

### Token for rewards

The Reward module triggers the minting of rewards in the fungible token identified by the value of `TOKEN_ID_REWARD`, which denotes a token ID. The value of `TOKEN_ID_REWARD` is set according to the initial configuration of the Reward module.

### Reward Brackets

As part of the Reward module configuration, the module has to define certain reward brackets, i.e., the values of the default block reward depending on the height of the block. For this LIP, we assume the reward brackets are given by the function `getDefaultRewardAtHeight(height)`, which returns a 64-bit unsigned integer value, the default block reward, given the block height `height` as input.

#### Reward Brackets Example

As an example, consider the reward brackets for the Lisk Mainchain:

| **Heights**                   | **Default Reward** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| From 1,451,520 to 4,451,519   | 5 × 10<sup>8</sup> |
| From 4,451,520 to 7,451,519   | 4 × 10<sup>8</sup> |
| From 7,451,520 to 10,451,519  | 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> |
| From 10,451,520 to 13,451,519 | 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> |
| From 13,451,520 onwards       | 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> |

This corresponds to default rewards of 5 LSK, 4 LSK, 3 LSK, 2 LSK, and 1 LSK respectively.

### State Store

This module does not define any state store.

### Commands

This module does not define any command.

### Events

#### RewardMinted

The event is emitted when the reward is minted. In case of a reward reduction, it provides information about the reason for the reduction. This event has `name = EVENT_NAME_REWARD_MINTED`.

#### Topics

* `generatorAddress`: the address of the block generator that obtains the reward.

#### Data

```java
rewardMintedDataSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["amount", "reduction"],
    "properties": {
        "amount": {
            "dataType": "uint64",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "reduction": {
            "dataType": "uint32",
            "fieldNumber": 2
        }
    }
}
```

* `amount`: the amount of rewards minted.
* `reduction`: an integer indicating whether the reward was reduced and for which reason. Allowed values are: `REWARD_NO_REDUCTION`, `REWARD_REDUCTION_SEED_REVEAL`, `REWARD_REDUCTION_MAX_PREVOTES`, and `REWARD_REDUCTION_NO_ACCOUNT`.

### Internal Functions

The Reward module has the following internal function.

#### getBlockReward

This function is used to retrieve the reward of a block at a given height.

##### Returns

* `amount`: amount of block reward to be minted.
* `reduction`: an integer indicating whether the reward is reduced. Possible values are `REWARD_NO_REDUCTION`, `REWARD_REDUCTION_SEED_REVEAL`, `REWARD_REDUCTION_MAX_PREVOTES`, and `REWARD_REDUCTION_NO_ACCOUNT`.

##### Execution

```python
def getBlockReward(blockHeader: BlockHeader) -> tuple[uint64, uint32]:
  if not Token.userSubstoreExists(blockHeader.generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_REWARD):
    return (0, REWARD_REDUCTION_NO_ACCOUNT)

  if isSeedRevealValid(blockHeader.generatorAddress, blockHeader.seedReveal) == False:
    return (0, REWARD_REDUCTION_SEED_REVEAL)

  defaultReward = getDefaultRewardAtHeight(blockHeader.height)
  if blockHeader.impliesMaxPrevotes == False:
    return (defaultReward / REWARD_REDUCTION_FACTOR_BFT, REWARD_REDUCTION_MAX_PREVOTES)

  return (defaultReward, REWARD_NO_REDUCTION)
```

Here `/` represents integer division, `isSeedRevealValid` is the function exposed by the [Random module][random-module].

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

This module does not define any specific logic for other modules.

### Endpoints for Off-Chain Services

The Reward module exposes the following functions for off-chain services.

#### getDefaultRewardAtHeight

This function is used to retrieve the expected default reward at a given height.

##### Parameters

The height of a block as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

##### Returns

The default reward of the block as a 64-bit unsigned integer.

### Block Processing

#### After Transactions Execution

The following function assigns block rewards after all transactions in the block are executed. Here we refer to the `mint` and `userSubstoreExists` functions exposed by the [Token module][token-module].

```python
def afterTransactionsExecute(b: Block) -> None:
    (blockReward, reduction) = getBlockReward(b.header)
    if blockReward > 0:
        Token.mint(b.header.generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_REWARD, blockReward)

    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_REWARD,
        name = EVENT_NAME_REWARD_MINTED,
        data = {
            "amount": blockReward,
            "reduction": reduction
            },
        topics = [b.header.generatorAddress]
    )
```

where `TOKEN_ID_REWARD` is the token ID of the token used for the reward system of the blockchain.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines the interface for the Reward module but does not introduce any change to the protocol, hence it is a backward compatible change.
