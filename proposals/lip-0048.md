## Abstract

The Fee module is responsible for handling the fee of transactions. It allows chains to choose the token used to pay the fee and to define a minimum fee for transactions to be valid.

## Motivation

This LIP defines the fee system in a modular way, as currently [used in the Lisk ecosystem][lip-0040]. The fee handling is implemented in a separate module to allow sidechains to freely update or replace the fee handling module, possibly to implement a more complex fee structure, without needing to modify or update the Token module.

## Rationale

### Transaction Fees

Blockchain transaction fees are instrumental for various reasons, including: 
- Paying for state growth, node computation, and blockspace utilization. 
- Preventing spamming a blockchain with unlimited zero-cost transactions. 
- Incentivizing validators who operate the network and maintain its security, by providing them with a part of collected fees.

Consequently, each transaction in the Lisk ecosystem has a *transaction fee* associated with it, as defined by the `fee` property of the transaction schema in [LIP 0068][lip-0068]. Each chain can configure the token used to pay fees, as defined by `TOKEN_ID_FEE`. On the Lisk mainchain, the token used for transaction fees is the LSK token.

The fee system proposed here automates the calculation of blockspace fees using a *minimum fee* approach: The transaction fee should be greater than or equal to a threshold that depends on the size of the transaction. Fees associated to other factors, such as state growth or computational effort, are determined by the corresponding parts of the protocol, e.g., fee for registering a validator in the PoS module. The fee module manages these *additional* fees through the [`payFee`](#payfee) method.

#### Minimum Fee per Transaction

As introduced in [LIP 0013][lip-0013], all transactions must have a transaction fee that is at least equal to a *minimum fee*. This fee corresponds to the cost of using blockspace and is therefore dependent on the size of the transaction, with the proportionality constant of `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE`: 
```python
trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
```
The minimum fee is always subtracted from the part of the fee that goes to the block generator, as we explain below. This way, block generators do not have the option to include zero-cost transactions in the blocks they generate, unless minimum fee is set to zero.

Note that chains can freely configure `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE`, which can even be set to zero. The `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` value cannot be changed, unless a hard fork occurs. For this reason, we allow sidechains to define a period of `MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE` blocks after the genesis block, for which the minimum fee does not apply. 

This could, for example, be beneficial for sidechains that want to use LSK as the fee token. Initially, there is no LSK on the sidechain, so the sidechain cannot process transactions unless `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` is set to zero, which is generally not desirable since it essentially disables the feature of minimum fee for the chain. By granting an initial exemption period of `MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE` blocks, users have a window of time to transfer LSK tokens to the sidechain, after which the initially set value of `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` would start being applied. 

#### Additional Fees

In principle, any transaction that results in a state increase or significant computational effort could require a fee. Since the current implementation does not provide an automatic way to charge fees in these cases, we introduce the [`payFee`](#payfee) method. 

This method can be invoked by other modules to charge an additional fee when a state increase is triggered during the execution of a transaction, e.g., when a new [validator is registered][lip-0057#execution] in the PoS module, a new [sidechain is registered][lip-0043#execution], or a [user account is initialized][lip-0051#initializeuseraccountinternal] in the Token module: 
```python
Fee.payFee(USER_ACCOUNT_INITIALIZATION_FEE)
```
In addition, developers may decide to call the `payFee` method for transactions that require extensive computation, e.g., when verifying an inclusion proof, or if any other resource is extensively used during transaction execution.

#### Transaction Fee Processing

We refer to the sum of the minimum fee and the additional fees processed by the `payFee` method as the "consumed" part of the fee. The remainder of the fee, called the "available" part of the fee, is transferred to the validator as a reward. In this way, validators are assumed to prioritize transactions with a higher available fee in case of network congestion. [After the transaction is executed](#after-command-execution), consumed fees are either burned or transferred to a dedicated pool address. 

The option to transfer the consumed fees to a dedicated pool address `ADDRESS_FEE_POOL` could be beneficial for sidechains, as fees collected this way can be used as an incentive for validators and other protocol participants for various purposes: Funding a community pool for on-chain governance spending, sharing funds proportionally among validators per round, incentivizing ecosystem developers, supporting chain maintenance and improvement, rewarding users' staking and voting activities, etc.

In the Lisk mainchain, the consumed fees are always burned. This reduces the total supply, creating a deflationary pressure that works against inflation.

### Cross-chain Message Fees

Cross-chain messages (CCMs) facilitate interoperability by enabling cross-chain transfer of data. Each CCM contains a [*message fee*][lip-0049#ccmschema], intended to cover the cost of transaction processing on the receiving chain (see [LIP 0049][lip-0049#fee]). 

Since managing message fees requires checking and updating the escrow balances for the message fee token, this task is assigned to the Token module whose [`payMessageFee`][lip-0051#paymessagefee] method charges message fees in the sending chain. In the receiving chain, the Token module assigns the message fee to the relayer account and updates escrows if necessary, and then the Fee module handles the message fee processing in a similar way as it handles transaction fees.

#### Minimum Fee per CCM

For protocol reasons (see, e.g., [`bounce`][lip-0045#bounce] and [`terminateChain`][lip-0045#terminatechain] methods in LIP 0045), the Interoperability module allows the message fee to be zero. Consequently, the choice of setting a minimum message fee is delegated to each module that provides its own cross-chain commands. Nevertheless, there is a minimum fee in case the user wants the failed CCM to be returned (see [`bounce`][lip-0045#bounce] method in LIP 0045). Thus, even though this fee is not mandatory, it is advisable to treat it as a suggested minimum fee. Note also that the CCM sender should include any additional fees necessary for the CCM execution, e.g., to pay for the user account initialization on the receiving chain.

#### Message Fee Processing

Processing of message fees is similar to that of transaction fees. The only essential difference is that the consumed part of the message fee contains only the so-called additional fees, as there is no mandatory minimum fee. The consumed part is handled in the same way as for transactions, i.e., it is either burned or transferred to a fee pool, depending on the chain configuration. 

The available part of the message fee is left to the relayer to cover the cost of CCU execution (recall that a CCU is a regular transaction, therefore the relayer has to pay transaction fees for posting the CCU in the receiving chain), as well as to incentivize its participation in CCM relaying. 

Finally, note that, in contrast to including transactions in a block, a relayer cannot prioritize CCMs with higher fees as the interoperability protocol requires them to be sent in order. This implies that users have no reason to pay higher message fees than are required for successful CCM execution. As a consequence, users understand that CCMs will be delivered as soon as a relayer decides to post the CCU in the target chain, eliminating any concerns about potential delays due to priority-related reasons.

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

#### payFee

```python
def payFee(amount: uint64) -> None:
    # ctx.ccmProcessing is set by the Interoperability module during the CCM processing.
    # In particular, before the CCM is processed, ctx.ccmProcessing is set to True.
    # After the CCM is processed, ctx.ccmProcessing is set to False.
    if ctx.ccmProcessing:
        ctx.availableCCMFee -= amount
        if ctx.availableCCMFee < 0:
            ctx.availableCCMFee = 0
            emitPersistentEvent(
                module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
                name = EVENT_NAME_INSUFFICIENT_FEE,
                data = {},
                topics = []
            )
            raise Exception("Cross-chain message ran out of fee.")
    else:
        ctx.availableTransactionFee -= amount
        if ctx.availableTransactionFee < 0:
            ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0
            emitPersistentEvent(
                module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
                name = EVENT_NAME_INSUFFICIENT_FEE,
                data = {},
                topics = []
            )
            raise Exception("Transaction ran out of fee.")
```

#### getFeeTokenID

```python
def getFeeTokenID() -> TokenID:
    return TOKEN_ID_FEE
```

### Block Processing

#### Verify Transaction

This step is run for every transaction before it is submitted to the chain. See [LIP 0055][lip-0055] for details of block processing.

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    b = block including trs
    h = b.header.height
    if h < MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE:
        # Set minFee = 0 for the first MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE blocks.
        minFee = 0
    else:    
        trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
        minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
    if trs.fee < minFee:
        raise Exception("Insufficient transaction fee")
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    if not Token.userSubstoreExists(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        raise Exception("Account not initialized")
    if trs.fee > Token.getAvailableBalance(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        raise Exception("Insufficient balance")
```

#### Before Command Execution

```python
def beforeCommandExecute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    Token.lock(senderAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee)
    minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * len(encodeTransaction(trs))
    ctx.availableTransactionFee = trs.fee - minFee
```

#### After Command Execution

```python
def afterCommandExecute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    let b be the block including trs
    generatorAddress = b.header.generatorAddress
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    # The fee paid to the generator is the difference between the fee paid by the sender and the paid fees.
    Token.unlock(senderAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee)

    if Token.userSubstoreExists(generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        Token.transfer(senderAddress, generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE, ctx.availableTransactionFee)
    else:
        ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0

    burnConsumedFee = False if (ADDRESS_FEE_POOL is not None and Token.userSubstoreExists(ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, TOKEN_ID_FEE)) else True

    if burnConsumedFee:
       Token.burn(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee)
    else:
       Token.transfer(senderAddress, ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee)

    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
        name = EVENT_NAME_GENERATOR_FEE_PROCESSED,
        data = {
            "senderAddress": senderAddress,
            "generatorAddress": generatorAddress,
            "requiredAmount": trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee,
            "generatorAmount": ctx.availableTransactionFee
        },
        topics = [senderAddress, generatorAddress]
    )
    ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0
```

### Cross-chain Update Processing

#### Before Cross-chain Command Execution

```python
def beforeCrossChainCommandExecution(trs: Transaction, ccm: CCM) -> None:
    # The Token module handles checks on the ccm.fee validity
    # with respect to the escrow account of the ccm sending chain.
    messageFeeTokenID = Interoperability.getMessageFeeTokenIDFromCCM(ccm)
    relayerAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]

    # The Token module beforeCrossChainCommandExecution needs to be called first
    # to ensure that the relayer has enough funds.
    Token.lock(relayerAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee)
    ctx.availableCCMFee = ccm.fee
```

#### After Cross-chain Command Execution

```python
def afterCrossChainCommandExecution(trs: Transaction, ccm: CCM) -> None:
    # The fee paid to the relayer is the difference between the message fee and the paid fees.
    relayerAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    messageFeeTokenID = Interoperability.getMessageFeeTokenIDFromCCM(ccm)
    Token.unlock(relayerAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee)

    burnConsumedFee = False if (ADDRESS_FEE_POOL is not None and Token.userSubstoreExists(ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, messageFeeTokenID)) else True

    if burnConsumedFee:
        Token.burn(relayerAddress, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee)
    else:
        # Transfer the cross-chain message fees to the pool account address, if it exists and it is initialized for the cross-chain message fee token.
        Token.transfer(relayerAddress, ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee)
    
    # No need to transfer as the remaining fee is already in the relayer account.    
    
    ccmID = sha256(encodeCCM(ccm))
    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
        name = EVENT_NAME_RELAYER_FEE_PROCESSED,
        data = {
            "ccmID": ccmID,
            "relayerAddress": relayerAddress,
            "requiredAmount": ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee,
            "relayerAmount": ctx.availableCCMFee
        },
        topics = [relayerAddress]
    )
    ctx.availableCCMFee = 0
```

### Endpoints for Off-Chain Services

This module does not have any non-trivial or recommended endpoints for off-chain services.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new Fee module, which follows the same protocol as currently implemented. Changing the implementation to include the Fee module will be backwards compatible.
