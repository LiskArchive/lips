## Abstract

The Fee module is responsible for handling the fee of transactions. It allows chains to choose the token used to pay the fee and to define a minimum fee for transactions to be valid.

## Copyright

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

This LIP defines the fee system in a modular way, as currently [used in the Lisk ecosystem][lip-0040]. The fee handling is implemented in a separate module to allow sidechains to freely update or replace the fee handling module, possibly to implement a more complex fee structure, without needing to modify or update the Token module.

## Rationale

### Fee Token ID

Each chain can configure the token used to pay fees. On the Lisk mainchain, the token used for transaction fees is the LSK token.

### Minimum Fee per Transaction

As introduced in [LIP 0013][lip-0013], all transactions must have a fee greater or equal to a minimum fee (which can be zero). The minimum fee is computed from the transaction size. Chains can configure their minimum fee per byte. The minimum part of the fee should be burned, this is to avoid that validators can send transactions in the blocks they generate without cost.

## Specification

### Type

We use the definition of the following type:

| Name | Type | Validation | Description |
|------|------|------------|-------------|
| `Transaction` | object | Must follow the `transactionSchema` schema defined in [LIP 0068](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0068.md) with the only difference that `params` property is not serialized and contains the values of parameters of `paramsSchema` for the corresponding transaction. | An object representing a non-serialized transaction. |

### Notation and Constants

We define the following constants:

| Name | Type | Value | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| **General Constants** | | | |
| `MODULE_NAME_FEE` | string | "fee" | Module name of the Fee module. |
| `EVENT_NAME_FEE_PROCESSED` | string | "feeProcessed" | Event name of the FeeProcessed event. |
| `LENGTH_ADDRESS` | uint32 | 20 | The length of an address in bytes. |
| **Configurable Constants** | | **Mainchain Value** | |
| `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` | uint64 | 1000 | Minimum amount of fee per byte required for transaction validity. |
| `TOKEN_ID_FEE` | bytes | `TOKEN_ID_LSK = 0x0000000000000000` | Token ID of the token used to pay the transaction fees. |

### Fee Module Store

The Fee module does not store information in the state.

### Commands

The Fee module does not contain any commands.

### Event

#### FeeProcessed

This event has name `name = EVENT_NAME_FEE_PROCESSED`. The event is emitted each time when a transaction fee is processed. Event's data includes the amount of burnt fee tokens and the amount of fee tokens paid to the block generator.

##### Topics

- `senderAddress`: the address of the account paying the fee.
- `generatorAddress`: the address of the generator of the block receiving the fee.

##### Data

```java
feeProcessedEventDataSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required" = ["senderAddress", "generatorAddress", "burntAmount", "generatorAmount"],
    "properties": {
        "senderAddress": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "length": LENGTH_ADDRESS,
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "generatorAddress": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "length": LENGTH_ADDRESS,
            "fieldNumber": 2
        },
        "burntAmount": {
            "dataType": "uint64",
            "fieldNumber": 3
        },
        "generatorAmount": {
            "dataType": "uint64",
            "fieldNumber": 3
        }
    }
}
```

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

The Fee module does not expose any functions.

### Block Processing

#### Verify Transaction

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
    minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
    if trs.fee < minFee:
         raise Exception("Insufficient transaction fee")
    senderAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    balance = Token.getAvailableBalance(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE)
    if trs.fee > balance:
        raise Exception("Insufficient balance")
```

#### Before Command Execution

```python
def beforeCommandExecute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    let b be the block including trs
    trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
    minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
    senderAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    generatorAddress = b.header.generatorAddress

    Token.burn(senderAddress,
               TOKEN_ID_FEE,
               minFee)
    Token.transfer(senderAddress,
                   generatorAddress,
                   TOKEN_ID_FEE,
                   trs.fee - minFee)
    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
        name = EVENT_NAME_FEE_PROCESSED,
        data = {
            "senderAddress": senderAddress,
            "generatorAddress": generatorAddress,
            "burntAmount": minFee,
            "generatorAmount": trs.fee - minFee
        },
        topics = [senderAddress, generatorAddress]
    )
```

The functions `Token.burn` and `Token.transfer` are defined in the [Token module][lip-0051]. Burning the fee was specified in [LIP 0013][lip-0013].

### Endpoints for Off-Chain Services

To be completed by the dev team.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new Fee module, which follows the same protocol as currently implemented. Changing the implementation to include the Fee module will be backwards compatible.

## Reference Implementation
