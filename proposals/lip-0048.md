## Abstract

The Fee module is responsible for handling the fee of transactions. It allows chains to choose the token used to pay the fee and to define a minimum fee for transactions to be valid.

## Copyright

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

This LIP defines the fee system in a modular way, as currently [used in the Lisk ecosystem][lip-0040]. The fee handling is implemented in a separate module to allow sidechains to freely update or replace the fee handling module, possibly to implement a more complex fee structure, without needing to modify or update the Token module.

## Rationale

Fees for blockchain transactions are necessary for a variety of reasons, including state growth, node computation, and block space utilization.

The current implementation lacks an automated method for calculating fees in all of these cases. Instead, we automate the calculation of block space fees using a *minimum fee* approach, similar to Bitcoin's mechanism, and allow developers discretion to use the [`payFee`](#payfee) method for fee assignment in other situations, e.g., when transaction implies state growth or more significant computational effort required by a node.

### Transaction Fees

Each transaction in the Lisk ecosystem has a *transaction fee* associated with it, as defined in [LIP 0068][lip-0068]. Transaction fees prevent spamming a blockchain with unlimited transactions at zero cost. In addition, a part of the transaction fee is provided as a reward to the validators who operate the network and maintain its security, as we explain in detail below. 

#### Fee Token ID

Each chain can configure the token used to pay fees, as defined by `TOKEN_ID_FEE`. On the Lisk mainchain, the token used for transaction fees is the LSK token.

#### Minimum Fee per Transaction

As introduced in [LIP 0013][lip-0013], all transactions must have a transaction fee that is greater than or equal to a *minimum fee* that is always deducted from the part of the fee that goes to the block generator. The minimum fee, unless it is zero, is intended to discourage validators from sending zero-cost transactions in the blocks they generate.

For a transaction `trs`, the minimum fee is determined by its size and the proportionality constant `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE`: 
```python
trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
```
Note that chains can freely configure their `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE`, which can even be set to zero. The `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` value cannot be changed, unless a hard fork occurs. For this reason, we allow sidechains to define a period of `MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE` blocks after the genesis block, for which the minimum fee does not apply. 

This could, for example, be useful for sidechains that want to use LSK as the fee token. Initially, there is no LSK on the sidechain, so the sidechain cannot process transactions unless `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` is set to zero, which is generally not desirable since it essentially disables the feature of minimum fee for the chain. By granting an initial exemption period of `MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE` blocks, users have a window of time to transfer LSK tokens to the sidechain, after which the initially set value of `MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE` would start being applied. 

### Method `payFee`

In principle, any transaction that results in a state increase or significant computational effort could require a fee. As mentioned above, since current implementation lacks an automated way of charging fees in these cases, we introduce the [`payFee`](#payfee) method. 

This method can be invoked by other modules to charge an additional fee when a state increase is triggered during the execution of a transaction, e.g., when a new validator is registered in the PoS module, a new sidechain is registered, or a user account is initialized in the Token module. Also, developers may decide to call the `payFee` method in transactions requiring an extensive computation, e.g., in verifying an inclusion proof.

For example, this method is called during the execution of the [validator registration command][lip-0057#execution] in LIP 0057: 
```python
Fee.payFee(VALIDATOR_REGISTRATION_FEE)
```

### Fee Processing

A part of the fee equal to the sum of the minimum fee and, if applicable, the initialization fee, is referred to as the *consumed fee*. [After the transaction is executed](#after-command-execution), consumed fee is either burned or transferred to a dedicated pool address. 

The remainder of the fee, referred to as the *available fee*, is given to the block generator as a reward. In this way, validators are assumed to prioritize transactions with a higher available fee  in the case of network congestion.

#### Fee Pool

As indicated earlier, chains can choose to either burn the consumed fees or transfer them to a dedicated pool address, `ADDRESS_FEE_POOL`. The latter could be beneficial for sidechains, as the fees collected in this way can be used as an incentive for validators and other protocol participants for various purposes, e.g., funding a community pool for on-chain governance spending, sharing funds proportionally among validators per round, incentivizing ecosystem developers, supporting chain maintenance and improvement, rewarding users' staking and voting activities, etc.

In the Lisk mainchain, the consumed fees are always burned. This reduces the total supply, creating a deflationary pressure that counteracts inflation.

### Cross-chain Message Fees

Cross-chain messages, or CCMs, facilitate interoperability by enabling cross-chain transfer of data. They require an associated fee, distinct from the usual transaction fee. Similar to transaction fees, the minimum fee can either be burned or transferred to a fee pool depending on the configuration of the chain, and the available fee is rewarded to a CCM relayer.

## Specification

### Type Definitions

We use the definition of the following types:

| Name          | Type   | Validation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Description                                          |

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

#### payFee

```python
def payFee(amount: uint64) -> None:
    # ctx.ccmProcessing is set by the Interoperability module during the CCM processing.
    # In particular, before the CCM is processed, ctx.ccmProcessing is set to True.
    # After the CCM is processed, ctx.ccmProcessing is set to False.
    if ctx.ccmProcessing:
        ctx.availableCCMFee -= amount
        if ctx.availableCCMFee < 0:
            ctx.availableCCMFee = 0
            emitPersistentEvent(
                module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
                name = EVENT_NAME_INSUFFICIENT_FEE,
                data = {},
                topics = []
            )
            raise Exception("Cross-chain message ran out of fee.")
    else:
        ctx.availableTransactionFee -= amount
        if ctx.availableTransactionFee < 0:
            ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0
            emitPersistentEvent(

                topics = []
            )
            raise Exception("Transaction ran out of fee.")
```

#### getFeeTokenID

```python
def getFeeTokenID() -> TokenID:
    return TOKEN_ID_FEE
```

### Block Processing

#### Verify Transaction

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    # This step is run for every transaction before it is submitted to the chain. See LIP 0055 for details of block processing.
    b = block including trs
    h = b.header.height
    if h < MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE:
        # Set minFee = 0 for the first MAX_BLOCK_HEIGHT_ZERO_FEE_PER_BYTE blocks.
        minFee = 0
    else:    
        trsSize = length(encodeTransaction(trs))
        minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * trsSize
    if trs.fee < minFee:
        raise Exception("Insufficient transaction fee")
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    if not Token.userSubstoreExists(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        raise Exception("Account not initialized")
    if trs.fee > Token.getAvailableBalance(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        raise Exception("Insufficient balance")
```

#### Before Command Execution

```python
def beforeCommandExecute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    Token.lock(senderAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee)
    minFee = MIN_FEE_PER_BYTE * len(encodeTransaction(trs))
    ctx.availableTransactionFee = trs.fee - minFee
```

#### After Command Execution

```python
def afterCommandExecute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    let b be the block including trs
    generatorAddress = b.header.generatorAddress
    senderAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    # The fee paid to the generator is the difference between the fee paid by the sender and the paid fees.
    Token.unlock(senderAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee)

    if Token.userSubstoreExists(generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE):
        Token.transfer(senderAddress, generatorAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE, ctx.availableTransactionFee)
    else:
        ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0

    burnConsumedFee = False if (ADDRESS_FEE_POOL is not None and Token.userSubstoreExists(ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, TOKEN_ID_FEE)) else True

    if burnConsumedFee:
       Token.burn(senderAddress, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee)
    else:
       Token.transfer(senderAddress, ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, TOKEN_ID_FEE, trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee)

    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
        name = EVENT_NAME_GENERATOR_FEE_PROCESSED,
        data = {
            "senderAddress": senderAddress,
            "generatorAddress": generatorAddress,
            "requiredAmount": trs.fee - ctx.availableTransactionFee,
            "generatorAmount": ctx.availableTransactionFee
        },
        topics = [senderAddress, generatorAddress]
    )
    ctx.availableTransactionFee = 0
```

### Cross-chain Update Processing

#### Before Cross-chain Command Execution

```python
def beforeCrossChainCommandExecution(trs: Transaction, ccm: CCM) -> None:
    # The Token module handles checks on the ccm.fee validity
    # with respect to the escrow account of the ccm sending chain.
    messageFeeTokenID = Interoperability.getMessageFeeTokenID(ccm.sendingChainID)
    relayerAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]

    # The Token module beforeCrossChainCommandExecution needs to be called first
    # to ensure that the relayer has enough funds.
    Token.lock(relayerAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee)
    ctx.availableCCMFee = ccm.fee
```

#### After Cross-chain Command Execution

```python
def afterCrossChainCommandExecution(trs: Transaction, ccm: CCM) -> None:
    # The fee paid to the relayer is the difference between the message fee and the paid fees.
    relayerAddress = sha256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:LENGTH_ADDRESS]
    messageFeeTokenID = Interoperability.getMessageFeeTokenID(ccm.sendingChainID)
    Token.unlock(relayerAddress, MODULE_NAME_FEE, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee)

    burnConsumedFee = False if (ADDRESS_FEE_POOL is not None and Token.userSubstoreExists(ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, messageFeeTokenID)) else True

    if burnConsumedFee:
        Token.burn(relayerAddress, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee)
    else:
        # Transfer the cross-chain message fees to the pool account address, if it exists and it is initialized for the cross-chain message fee token.
        Token.transfer(relayerAddress, ADDRESS_FEE_POOL, messageFeeTokenID, ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee)
    
    # No need to transfer as the remaining fee is already in the relayer account.    
    
    ccmID = sha256(encodeCCM(ccm))
    emitEvent(
        module = MODULE_NAME_FEE,
        name = EVENT_NAME_RELAYER_FEE_PROCESSED,
        data = {
            "ccmID": ccmID,
            "relayerAddress": relayerAddress,
            "requiredAmount": ccm.fee - ctx.availableCCMFee,
            "relayerAmount": ctx.availableCCMFee
        },
        topics = [relayerAddress]
    )
    ctx.availableCCMFee = 0
```

### Endpoints for Off-Chain Services

To be completed by the dev team.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new Fee module, which follows the same protocol as currently implemented. Changing the implementation to include the Fee module will be backwards compatible.
