## Abstract

This LIP introduces four new commands to the Lisk ecosystem: the state recovery command, the message recovery command, the state recovery initialization command, and the message recovery initialization command. The state recovery command is used to recover entries from the module store of a terminated sidechain. The message recovery command allows users to recover cross-chain messages that are pending in the outbox of an inactive or terminated sidechain. The state and message recovery initialization commands are used to initialize the state and message recovery process, respectively.

## Motivation

In the Lisk ecosystem, the ability of a sidechain to interoperate with other chains can be revoked, i.e., terminated, permanently. Specifically, this occurs when the sidechain has been inactive for too long, i.e., not posting a transaction with a [cross-chain update (CCU)][lip-0053] command for more than 30 days, or if it posted one with a malicious CCU command on the mainchain. Once a sidechain is terminated in the ecosystem, the users of said chain cannot have any cross-chain interaction with it. This means they will no longer be able to send or receive any (fungible or non-fungible) token, message or custom information from or to the sidechain. Therefore, it is useful to provide a trustless on-chain mechanism to recover tokens, messages and information from terminated sidechains. This mechanism will noticeably improve the user experience of the Lisk ecosystem without affecting the security guarantees of the general interoperability solution.

## Rationale

This LIP introduces new commands to the Lisk ecosystem to provide a recovery mechanism for sidechain users in the scenario stated in the previous section. These commands are part of the Lisk [Interoperability module][lip-0045], thus they make use of the information provided in the interoperability store of the terminated sidechain. The main use cases provided by this recovery mechanism are:

* On the Lisk mainchain:
  * The users can recover the balance of LSK they had on a terminated sidechain by submitting a transaction with a **state recovery command**.
  * The users can recover a [pending cross-chain message (CCM)][lip-0049] from the sidechain account outbox by submitting a transaction with a **message recovery command** on the Lisk mainchain.

* On sidechains:
  * The users can recover the balance of any custom token they had on a terminated sidechain by submitting a transaction with a **state recovery command**.
  * The users can recover any NFT they had on a terminated sidechain by submitting a transaction with a **state recovery command**.
  * The stored data of certain custom modules can be recovered from a terminated sidechain by submitting a transaction with a **state recovery command**.

In the next subsections, these mechanisms are explained together with their conditions, sidechain data availability requirements, effects, and their potential usage by certain network participants.

### State Recovery from the Sidechain State Root

This mechanism allows to recover a specific entry from a substore (i.e. the collection of key-value pairs with a common store prefix) of a module store of a terminated sidechain. Here "recover" means triggering a specific state transition defined as part of the relevant module protocol logic. In particular, it is based on the sidechain state root, `stateRoot`, set in the last certificate before sidechain termination. In the context of the mainchain, a valid state recovery command can recover the LSK token balance that users had in the terminated sidechain. In the context of a sidechain, it can recover an entry in a recoverable module store from a terminated sidechain. A recoverable module is any module that exposes a recover function. This includes the [Token module][lip-0051] (for any custom token) and the [NFT module][lip-0052].

This recovery mechanism requires these conditions to be valid:

* The state of the sidechain has to be consistent with respect to the value of the `stateRoot` property in the interoperability account of the sidechain in the mainchain.
* The specific entry of the substore of the recoverable module store to be recovered has to be available.
* The proof of inclusion for the specific entry to be recovered into the current `stateRoot` has to be available.
* When one of these commands is processed, the `stateRoot` property of the terminated sidechain is updated to account for the recovered tokens.
  * This implies that the future potential state recovery commands on a specific chain have to include a proof of inclusion into the updated sparse Merkle tree against the new `stateRoot`.

There is an extra requirement in the case of recoveries in the sidechain context: The sidechain in which the recovery will happen needs to be aware of the `stateRoot` of the terminated sidechain. In general, this information is only available on mainchain (in the terminated state account of the terminated sidechain). A way to make sidechains aware of this specific information for state recoveries is needed. This recovery initialization process on sidechains can happen in two ways:

* **State recovery initialization command**: This command is used to prove on a sidechain the value that the `stateRoot` of the terminated sidechain has on mainchain.
Any user on the corresponding sidechain can send a transaction with this command and initiate the state recoveries with respect to the terminated sidechain.
A sidechain account can be terminated on a sidechain using the `terminateChain` function exposed by the Interoperability module. In this case, the state root is generally not available and the terminated state account is created without setting the sidechain state root. Instead, the account stores the mainchain state root at the time of termination. A state recovery initialization command will in the future set the sidechain state root by giving an inclusion proof against this mainchain state root.
* **Sidechain terminated message**: As specified in the [cross-chain message LIP][lip-0049#terminatedMessage], when a CCM reaches a receiving chain that has been terminated, a sidechain terminated message is created and sent back to the sending chain carrying the `stateRoot` of the terminated sidechain. The application of this CCM on the sidechain will effectively initiate the recovery process.

Assuming these conditions are fulfilled, the entries of substores of any recoverable module in a terminated sidechain can be recovered back to the chain in which the transaction with this command was submitted. In particular, users can recover their LSK tokens back to their user account on mainchain. What is more, sidechain developers may implement any custom logic for the `recover` function in their custom modules, so that recoveries may have different functionalities depending on the module and the sidechain where the process happens.

Similar to the case for message recovery commands, it is not guaranteed to recover from the expected state in every situation. Certain state information of the terminated sidechain might have been modified and certified to the mainchain before termination.

In summary, the functionality provided by these recovery commands applies for sidechains that were terminated for inactivity or [other violations of the interoperability protocol][lip-0053#violations]. If the validators of the terminated sidechain were byzantine in the past, i.e., the security guarantees of the sidechain were broken, it is likely that these recovery mechanisms would not work.

### Message Recovery from the Sidechain Account Outbox

This mechanism allows to recover any CCM pending in the sidechain outbox. That is, those CCMs that have not been included in the receiving sidechain yet.
Specifically, this includes all the CCMs whose indices (the position of these CCMs in the sidechain outbox tree) are larger than the index of the last message that the receiving sidechain reported to have included in its inbox on the mainchain. This recovery mechanism requires these conditions to work as follows:

* The sidechain chain account has been terminated on the mainchain, i.e. there exists an entry in the terminated chain substore with store key equal to the sidechain chain ID. This entry is created automatically on the mainchain.
* There exists an entry in the terminated outbox substore with store key equal to the sidechain chain ID. This entry is created by the message recovery initialization command, which can be submitted after the chain account has been terminated.
* The pending CCMs to be recovered have to be available to the sender of the recovery command.
* The indices of the pending CCMs to be recovered have to be larger than the value of the `partnerChainInboxSize` property of the terminated outbox account. This implies that these CCMs are still pending or that their processing has not been certified to the mainchain.
* The proof of inclusion for the pending CCMs into the  `outboxRoot` property of the terminated outbox account has to be available. When a message recovery command is processed, the `outboxRoot` property is updated to account for the recovered CCMs (see Figure 1). This implies that the future potential message recovery commands have to include a proof of inclusion into the updated Merkle tree against the new `outboxRoot`.

![CCM_recovery](lip-0054/ccm_recovery.png)

_Figure 1: (top) The message recovery command recovers CCM<sub>32</sub> and CCM<sub>34</sub> by providing their indices and the sibling hashes to compute the outbox root (the proof of inclusion for these CCMs in the tree). The data provided by the command is highlighted in red in the tree. (bottom) The outbox root is then updated by recomputing the Merkle tree root with the recovered CCMs. In the second Merkle tree the updated nodes are highlighted in green. A new recovery command will need to provide a proof of inclusion for this updated Merkle tree._

Assuming these conditions are fulfilled, any user can submit a message recovery command to recover several CCMs at the same time. When the command is processed, the corresponding CCMs are recovered differently depending on their sending chain:

* If the sending chain of the pending CCM is the Lisk mainchain, it must be a cross-chain LSK token transfer CCM. The amount of LSK transferred in the CCM will be added back to the sender of the original transaction.
* If the sending chain of the pending CCM is any other sidechain, the CCM will be sent back to this chain. The sending sidechain will act on the CCM as usual, i,e., with respect to the specific logic associated with the cross-chain command.

Bearing in mind that users are not guaranteed to recover their CCMs in every situation. Certain state information of the terminated sidechain might have been modified before termination and this would make the recovered CCM application fail. For example, the escrowed LSK in the sidechain account on the mainchain could have been subtracted by prior malicious behavior in the terminated sidechain.

### Recovery Commands as an Off-chain Service

As explained in the previous subsections, these recovery commands require specific information from the terminated sidechain to be available. For the message recovery mechanism, the mainchain chain account on the sidechain, all the pending CCMs, their position in the sidechain outbox root, and the state of the sidechain outbox (root, size, and append path) up to the last non-pending CCM have to be available. For the state recovery mechanism, the sidechain state up to the last valid cross-chain update has to be available. Moreover, this information has to be updated for future recovery commands every time a recovery command is successfully processed.

Message recovery commands are better suited to be submitted by accounts with access to a Lisk mainchain full node. The complete Merkle tree with root equal to the last value of the `outboxRoot` property of the terminated outbox account can be computed from the history of the Lisk mainchain. On the other hand, to submit a state recovery command or the message recovery initialization command, it is necessary to have access to a full node of the sidechain. In particular, this node should keep a snapshot of the sidechain state tree corresponding to the last certified `stateRoot` on mainchain. As explained above, these commands require the state of the sidechain to be consistent with the last value of `stateRoot`. However, the state of the sidechain may have evolved since the last CCU. That is why if a sidechain node intends to be ready to eventually submit these commands, they need to store this extra state information.

Since these technical requirements are not straightforward, the recovery commands are better suited to be offered as an off-chain service to sidechain users. When a sidechain is terminated, these recovery-service providers can recover the CCMs, tokens, NFTs or in general, any cross-chain information for the interested users.

#### Verification

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    # The terminated account has to exist for this sidechain
    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID) does not exists:
        raise Exception("Terminated state account does not exist.")
    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).initialized == False:
        raise Exception("Terminated state account is not initialized.")

    terminatedStateRoot = terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).stateRoot

    queryKeys = []
    storeQueries = []

    for entry in trs.params.storeEntries:
        queryKeys.append(entry.storeKey)
        query = { 
            "key": trs.params.module + entry.substorePrefix + entry.storeKey,
            "value": sha256(entry.storeValue),
            "bitmap": entry.bitmap
        }
        storeQueries.append(query)

    proofOfInclusionStores = { siblingHashes: trs.params.siblingHashes, queries : storeQueries }

    if SMTVerify(queryKeys, proofOfInclusionStores, terminatedStateRoot) == False:
        raise Exception("State recovery proof of inclusion is not valid.")
```

#### Execution

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    storeQueries = []

    for entry in trs.params.storeEntries:
        # The recover function corresponding to the module ID applies the recovery logic
        recoveryModule = module associated with trs.params.module
        recoveryModule.recover(trs.params.chainID, entry.substorePrefix, entry.storeKey, entry.storeValue)

        emptyStore = EMPTY_BYTES 
        query = { 
            "key": trs.params.module + entry.substorePrefix + entry.storeKey,
            "value": sha256(emptyStore),
            "bitmap": entry.bitmap
        }
        storeQueries.append(query)

    terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).stateRoot = SMTCalculateRoot(trs.params.siblingHashes, storeQueries)
```

#### Recover Function

For the verification and application of this command it is assumed that the module given by `trs.params.module` exposes a `recover` function, with the following interface:

```python
def recover(terminatedChainID: ChainID, substorePrefix: bytes, storeKey: bytes, storeValue: bytes),
```

where:

* `terminatedChainID`: The ID of the terminated chain.
* `substorePrefix`: The store prefix of the store entry in the recoverable module state.
* `storeKey`: The store key of the store entry in the recoverable module state.
* `storeValue`: The store value of the store entry in the recoverable module state.

The `recover` function is specified for the [Token module][lip-0051#recover] and in the [NFT module][lip-0052#recover].

### Message Recovery Command

This command is used to recover cross-chain messages from a terminated outbox.

Transactions executing this command have:

* `module = MODULE_NAME_INTEROPERABILITY`,
* `command = COMMAND_MESSAGE_RECOVERY`.

#### Verification

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    if trs.params.chainID == CHAIN_ID_MAINCHAIN or trs.params.chainID == ownChainAccount.chainID:
        raise Exception("Chain ID is not valid.")

    # The commands fails if the sidechain is already terminated on this chain
    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID) exists and terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).initialized == True:
        raise Exception("Sidechain is already terminated.")

    sidechainAccount = decode(chainAccountSchema, trs.params.sidechainChainAccount)
    # The commands fails if the sidechain is not terminated and did not violate the liveness requirement
    if sidechainAccount.status != CHAIN_STATUS_TERMINATED
        and chainAccount(CHAIN_ID_MAINCHAIN).lastCertificate.timestamp - sidechainAccount.lastCertificate.timestamp < LIVENESS_LIMIT:
        raise Exception("Sidechain is not terminated.")

    interopAccKey = MODULE_NAME_INTEROPERABILITY + SUBSTORE_PREFIX_CHAIN_DATA + sha256(trs.params.chainID)

    query = { 
        "key": interopAccKey,
        "value": sha256(trs.params.sidechainChainAccount),
        "bitmap": trs.params.bitmap 
    }

    proofOfInclusion = { "siblingHashes": trs.params.siblingHashes, "queries" : [query] }

    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID) exists:
        if SMTVerify([interopAccKey], proofOfInclusion, terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).mainchainStateRoot) == False:
            raise Exception("State recovery initialization proof of inclusion is not valid.")
    else:
        if SMTVerify([interopAccKey], proofOfInclusion, chainAccount(CHAIN_ID_MAINCHAIN).lastCertificate.stateRoot) == False:
            raise Exception("State recovery initialization proof of inclusion is not valid.")
```

#### Execution

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    sidechainAccount = decode(chainAccountSchema, trs.params.sidechainChainAccount)
    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID) exists:
        terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).stateRoot = sidechainAccount.lastCertificate.stateRoot
        terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).mainchainStateRoot = EMPTY_BYTES
        terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).initialized = True
    else:
        createTerminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID, sidechainAccount.lastCertificate.stateRoot)
```

The `createTerminatedStateAccount` function is defined in [LIP 0045][lip-0045].

### Message Recovery Initialization Command

This command is used to initialize a terminated outbox account.

Transactions executing this command have:

* `module = MODULE_NAME_INTEROPERABILITY`,
* `command = COMMAND_MESSAGE_RECOVERY_INITIALIZATION`.

#### Parameters

```java
messageRecoveryInitializationParams = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "chainID",
        "channel",
        "bitmap",
        "siblingHashes"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "chainID": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "length": CHAIN_ID_LENGTH,
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "channel": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 2
        },
        "bitmap": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 3
        },
        "siblingHashes": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "dataType": "bytes",
                "length": HASH_LENGTH
            },
            "fieldNumber": 4
        }
    }
}
```

#### Verification

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    if trs.params.chainID == CHAIN_ID_MAINCHAIN or trs.params.chainID == ownChainAccount.chainID:
        raise Exception("Chain ID is not valid.")

    # The commands fails if the  chain is not registered
    if chainAccount(trs.params.chainID) does not exists:
        raise Exception("Chain is not registered.")

    # The commands fails if the chain is not terminated
    if terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID) does not exists or terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).initialized == False:
        raise Exception("Chain is not terminated.")

    # The commands fails if there exist already a terminated outbox account
    if terminatedOutboxAccount(trs.params.chainID) exists:
        raise Exception("Terminated outbox account already exists.")

    channelKey = MODULE_NAME_INTEROPERABILITY + SUBSTORE_PREFIX_CHANNEL_DATA + sha256(CHAIN_ID_MAINCHAIN)

    query = { 
        key: channelKey,
        value: sha256(trs.params.channel),
        bitmap: trs.params.bitmap 
    }

    proofOfInclusion = { siblingHashes: trs.params.siblingHashes, queries : [query] }

    if SMTVerify([channelKey], proofOfInclusion, terminatedStateAccount(trs.params.chainID).stateRoot) == False:
        raise Exception("Message recovery initialization proof of inclusion is not valid.")
```

#### Execution

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    partnerChannel = decode(channelSchema, trs.params.channel)
    createTerminatedOutboxAccount(
        trs.params.chainID,
        channel(trs.params.chainID).outbox.root,
        channel(trs.params.chainID).outbox.size,
        partnerChannel.inbox.size
    )
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP introduces new commands with new effects to the Lisk mainchain state, thus it will imply a hardfork. It also implies that sidechains implement the Interoperability module, recoverable modules and follow the standard state model structure.
