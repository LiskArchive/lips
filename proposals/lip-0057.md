## Abstract

The PoS (proof-of-stake) module is responsible for handling validator registration, votes, and computing the validator weight. In this LIP, we specify the properties of the PoS module, along with their serialization and initial values.
Furthermore, we specify the state transitions logic defined within this module, i.e. the commands, the protocol logic injected during the block lifecycle, and the functions that can be called from other modules or off-chain services. We also specify the events emitted by the PoS module.

## Copyright

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

The PoS module handles all aspects of the generator selection, this includes the registration of accounts as validators, the voting process, and potential misbehavior reports.

In this LIP we specify the properties, serialization, initialization, and exposed functions of the PoS module, as well as the protocol logic processed during a block life cycle and the module commands.

## Rationale

This LIP does not introduce significant protocol changes to the generator selection mechanism proposed in [LIP 0022][lip-0022] and [LIP 0023][lip-0023]. It only defines how the commands and processes defined in those LIPs are integrated in the [state model][lip-0040] used in Lisk. Please see [LIP 0022][lip-0022] and [LIP 0023][lip-0023] for a thorough rationale regarding the choice of voting system and the inclusion of standby validators. [LIP 0022][lip-0022] defines a selection mechanism for 2 standby validators. In this LIP, we slightly extend the specifications to support 0 or 1 standby validator, however, we do not specify how to extend the protocol to more than 2 validators. Introducing more standby validators might require a different source of randomness and it is not the aim of this LIP to describe this topic.

### PoS Store

#### Voter Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain the votes and recent unvotes of users (the ones for which the unvoted amount has not been unlocked). The entries are keyed by address and contain an array of the current votes as well as an array of objects representing the tokens waiting to be unlocked.

#### Validator Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain all information regarding the registered validators. It is keyed by address and contains values for the validator name, last generated height, total votes received, proof-of-misbehaviour heights, and a flag asserting if the validator is banned or not.

#### Name Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain a list of all names already registered. It allows the protocol to efficiently process the validator registration transaction. The entries are keyed by validator name and the value contains the address of the corresponding validator.

#### Eligible Validators Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain the list of all non-banned validators that have more validator weight than a specified threshold. The validators from this list with the most weight are active validators, and the others are standby validators.

#### Snapshot Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain the needed snapshots of the eligible validators. The entries are keyed by round number and contain the addresses and weights of eligible validators at the end of the corresponding round. Based on this information, the sets of active and standby validators are selected two rounds later. Entries for older rounds which are no longer necessary are removed.

#### Genesis Data Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain information from the genesis block. This information is used to compute if a block is at the end of a round, and to generate the generator list during the bootstrap period.

#### Previous Timestamp Substore

This part of the state store is used to maintain the timestamp of the last block added to the chain. This is used when calling the function computing missed blocks from the Validators module.

### Setting BFT Weights

In this LIP, we set the BFT weights of active validators to be proportional to their validator weight. Additionally, to avoid a large concentration of BFT weight in one or only very few validators, we introduce a capping threshold for the BFT weight, i.e., we do not allow one validator to get more than a a certain percentage of the total BFT weight. This threshold is specified by the constant `MAX_BFT_WEIGHT_CAP`; for the Lisk mainchain, it is set to 5 %.

Note that further we choose `floor(2/3 * aggregateBFTWeight) + 1` as precommit and certificate threshold for PoS chains, see [LIP 0058][lip-0058] for an explanation of these parameters. Here `aggregateBFTWeight` is the sum of BFT weights of the active validators. This choice of BFT parameters means that the safety and liveness of the BFT consensus protocol is ensured if `<1/3 * aggregateBFTWeight` is malicious (for the case of changing validators the guarantees are slightly weaker). The capping of BFT weights to 5 % for the Lisk mainchain implies that at least 7 validators would need to be malicious as any set of 6 validators would have `<1/3 * aggregateBFTWeight` BFT weight. Similarly, only a set of at least 14 validators could have BFT weight of `>= floor(2/3 * aggregateBFTWeight) + 1` and would therefore be able to generate any certificate. Hence, the capping ensures a minimum of decentralization in the validator set, even in the case of very unbalanced validator weight distribution. In practice, we expect the capping to only effect very few validators, in particular, as rewards are also distributed proportional to the BFT weights.

By setting the BFT weights proportional to validator weight instead of uniform BFT weights for all active validators as done before, we can improve the security guarantees of the BFT consensus protocol. If we neglect the effect of capping, which will likely effect only very few validators by a small percentage, then more than 1/3 of the active validator weight are needed to have more than 1/3 of the BFT weight for an attack of the network. Assuming validators generally have at least 10 % self-votes, this translates to at least 1/3 of the stake used in voting would have to be controlled by the attacker.

In the current system of uniform BFT weights this is not the case. The set of 34 lowest-weight validators may have significantly less than 1/3 of the total validator weight although their total BFT weight is more than 1/3. This means that quite a lot less than 1/3 of the voting stake is sufficient to control more than 1/3 of BFT weight, which would be sufficient to perform an attack on the network. Choosing BFT weights proportional to validator weight avoids this issue.

##### Properties

In this section, we describe the properties of the voter substore.

* `sentVotes`: stores an array of the current votes of a user. This array was called `votes` in [LIP 0023][lip-0023].
  Each vote is represented by the address of the voted validator and the amount of tokens that have been used to vote for the validator; in case reward sharing is enabled, the vote also includes the [sharing coefficients][lip-reward-sharing#efficient-calculation-of-rewards] at the time of voting (or at the last time rewards for this vote were claimed).
  This array is updated with a [vote command](#vote).
  The `sentVotes` array is always kept ordered in lexicographical order of `validatorAddress`.
  Its size is at most `MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES`, any state transition that would increase it to above `MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES` is invalid.
  Any element with `amount == 0` is removed from the array.
  For all elements of this array, the `voteSharingCoefficients` array is always kept ordered in lexicographical order of `tokenID`
* `pendingUnlocks`: stores an array representing the tokens that have been unvoted, but not yet unlocked.
  Each unvote generates an object in this array containing the address of the unvoted validator, the amount of the unvote and the height at which the unvote was included in the chain.
  Objects in this array get removed when the corresponding [unlock command](#unlock) is executed. This array was called `unlocking` in [LIP 0023][lip-0023].
  This array is updated with [vote](#vote) and [unlock](#unlock) commands.
  The `pendingUnlocks` array is always kept ordered by lexicographical order of `validatorAddress`, ties broken by increasing `amount`, ties broken by increasing `unvoteHeight`.
  The size of the `pendingUnlocks` array is at most `MAX_NUMBER_PENDING_UNLOCKS`, any state transition that would increase it to above `MAX_NUMBER_PENDING_UNLOCKS` is invalid.
  NB: by construction, all elements of this array will have `amount != 0`.
* If any state transition would result in a voter substore entry to have `sentVotes == []` and `pendingUnlocks == []`, the entry is removed from the store.

#### Validator Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_DELEGATE`.
* Each store key is a `ADDRESS_LENGTH`-byte `address`, representing a validator address.
* Each store value is the serialization of an object following `validatorStoreSchema`.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let `validatorStore(address)` be the value stored in the validator substore with store key `address`, deserialized using `validatorStoreSchema`.

##### Properties

In this section, we describe the properties of the validator substore. Entries in this substore can be created during the execution of the genesis block. When the chain is running, entries in this substore are created by a [validator registration command](#validator-registration) and its value is set during the command execution. It contains information about the validator whose address is the store key.

* `name`: a string representing the validator name, with a minimum length of `1` character and a maximum length of `MAX_LENGTH_NAME`.
* `totalVotesReceived`: the sum of all votes received by a validator.
* `selfVotes` : the sum of all votes the validator cast for its own account.
* `lastGeneratedHeight`: the height at which the validator last generated a block.
* `isBanned`: a Boolean value indicating if the validator is banned or not. Banned validators are never chosen to generate new blocks.
* `pomHeights`:  the heights at which a proof of misbehavior command was successfully executed with blocks generated by the validator.
* `consecutiveMissedBlocks`: the number of consecutive missed blocks by the validator. This value resets to 0 whenever a block generated by the validator is included in the blockchain.

The following three properties are relevant only in case reward sharing is enabled. See the [Reward sharing LIP][lip-reward-sharing] for more details.

* `commission`: a number specifying the commission of the validator. We use two decimals precision, i.e., the number will be an integer from 0 to 10000, where the commission percentage is commission/100.  
* `lastCommissionIncreaseHeight` : the height at which the validator last increased the commission.
* `sharingCoefficients`: an array containing the value of the sharing coefficients of the validator for each token.

#### Name Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_NAME`.
* Each store key is a utf8-encoded string `name`, representing a validator name.
* Each store value is the serialization of an object following `nameStoreSchema`.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let `nameStore(name)` be the value stored in the name substore with store key `name`, deserialized using `nameStoreSchema`.

##### JSON Schema

```java
nameStoreSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["validatorAddress"],
    "properties": {
        "validatorAddress": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "length": ADDRESS_LENGTH,
            "fieldNumber": 1
        }
    }
}
```

##### Properties

The name substore maintains all registered names, using the name as store key and storing the address of the validator that registered that name in the corresponding store value. Entries in this substore are created during the execution of [validator registration command](#validator-registration).

#### Eligible Validators Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_ELIGIBLE_DELEGATES`.
* For the entry corresponding to a validator, the store key is the concatenation of the validator weight (represented using the big endian uint64 serialization) and the validator address, i.e.,  `weight.to_bytes(8,'big') + address`.
* Each store value is the serialization of an object following `eligibleValidatorsStoreSchema`.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let `eligibleValidatorsStore(key)` be the value stored in the eligible validators substore with store key `key`, deserialized using `eligibleValidatorsStoreSchema`.

##### JSON Schema

```java
eligibleValidatorsStoreSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["lastPomHeight"],
    "properties": {
        "lastPomHeight": {
            "dataType": "uint32",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        }
    }
}
```

##### Properties

In this section, we describe the properties of the eligible validators substore.

* `lastPomHeight`:  the height of the last proof of misbehavior transaction against the specified validator. It's default value is 0.

This substore only maintains an entry for validators that have weight more than `MIN_WEIGHT`, and that are not banned. It is updated via the [`updateValidatorEligibility` function](#updatevalidatoreligibility).

#### Snapshot Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_SNAPSHOT`.
* Each store key is `roundNumber.to_bytes(4,'big')`, i.e., the big endian uint32 serialization of `roundNumber`, where `roundNumber` is the number of the round at the end of which the active validators and weights are computed. These values will be used to compute the validator set for round `roundNumber + 2`.
* Each store value is the serialization of an object following `snapshotStoreSchema`.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let `snapshotStore(roundNumber)` be the value stored in the snapshot substore with store key `roundNumber.to_bytes(4,'big')`, deserialized using `snapshotStoreSchema`.

##### JSON Schema

```java
snapshotStoreSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["validatorWeightSnapshot"],
    "properties": {
        "validatorWeightSnapshot": {
            "type": "array",
            "fieldNumber": 1,
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": ["address", "weight"],
                "properties": {
                    "address": {
                        "dataType": "bytes",
                        "length": ADDRESS_LENGTH,
                        "fieldNumber": 1
                    },
                    "weight": {
                        "dataType": "uint64",
                        "fieldNumber": 2
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `validatorWeightSnapshot` array is ordered by decreasing `weight`, ties broken by reverse lexicographical ordering of `address`.

##### Properties

In this section, we describe the properties of the snapshot substore.

* `validatorWeightSnapshot`: all validator addresses and weights of all non-banned validators with more than `MIN_WEIGHT` validator weight for the given round number.

The snapshot substore is initially empty.

#### Genesis Data Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_GENESIS_DATA`.
* The store key is set to empty bytes.
* The store value is the serialization of an object following `genesisDataStoreSchema`.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let:
  * `genesisDataStore.height` be the `height` property of the entry in the genesis data substore.
  * `genesisDataStore.initRounds` be the `initRounds` property of the entry in the genesis data substore.
  * `genesisDataStore.initValidators` be the `initValidators` property of the entry in the genesis data substore.

##### JSON Schema

```java
genesisDataStoreSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "height",
        "initRounds",
        "initValidators"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "height": {
            "dataType": "uint32",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "initRounds": {
            "dataType": "uint32",
            "fieldNumber": 2
        },
        "initValidators": {
            "type": "array",
            "fieldNumber": 3,
            "items": {
                "dataType": "bytes",
                      "length": ADDRESS_LENGTH
             }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Properties

The genesis data substore stores information from the genesis block. It is initialized when processing the genesis block.

* `height`: height of the genesis block.
* `initRounds`: the length of the [bootstrap period][lip-0034#bootstrap-period], also called initial rounds. `initRounds` must be at least `MIN_INIT_ROUNDS`.
* `initValidators`: the addresses of the validators to be used during the bootstrap period. This property must have a non-empty value.

#### Previous Timestamp Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `SUBSTORE_PREFIX_PREVIOUS_TIMESTAMP`.
* The store key is set to empty bytes.
* The store value is the serialization of an object following `previousTimestampStoreSchema`
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal, let `previousTimestamp` be the `timestamp` property of the entry in the previous timestamp substore.

##### JSON Schema

```java
previousTimestampStoreSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["timestamp"],
    "properties": {
        "timestamp": {
            "dataType": "uint32",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        }
    }
}
```

##### Properties

`timestamp`: The timestamp of the last block added to the chain.

def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    validatorAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:ADDRESS_LENGTH] # Derive validatorAddress from trs.senderPublicKey.    

    if there exists an entry validatorStore(validatorAddress) in validator substore:
        raise Exception('This address has already registered a validator.')
    if not isValidatorNameValid(trs.params.name):
        raise Exception('Invalid name')
    if there exists an entry nameStore(trs.params.name) in name substore:
        raise Exception('Name already used by a validator.')
    if trs.fee < DELEGATE_REGISTRATION_FEE:
        raise Exception('Insufficient transaction fee.')
```

##### Execution

When a transaction `trs` executing a validator registration command included in a block `b`, the logic below is followed:

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    b = block including trs
    validatorAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:ADDRESS_LENGTH] # Derive validatorAddress from trs.senderPublicKey.
    validatorName = trs.params.name

    # This step also checks that the BLS key has not been used from another validator.
    Validators.registerValidatorKeys(validatorAddress,
                                    trs.params.proofOfPossession,
                                    trs.params.generatorKey,
                                    trs.params.blsKey)

    # The new validator pays the registration fee.
    Fee.payFee(DELEGATE_REGISTRATION_FEE)

    # Update validator substore.
    validatorState = {
            "name": validatorName,
            "totalVotesReceived": 0,
            "selfVotes": 0,
            "lastGeneratedHeight": b.header.height,
            "isBanned": False,
            "pomHeights": [],
            "consecutiveMissedBlocks": 0,
            "commission": 10000,
            "lastCommissionIncreaseHeight": b.header.height,
            "sharingCoefficients": []
        }

    create an entry in the validator substore with
        storeKey = validatorAddress,
        storeValue =  encode(validatorStoreSchema, validatorState)

    # Update name substore.
    create an entry in the name substore with
        storeKey = validatorName encoded as utf8,
        storeValue = encode(nameStoreSchema, {"validatorAddress": validatorAddress})

    # Emit event for the successful validator registration.
    emitEvent(
            module=MODULE_NAME_POS,
            name=EVENT_NAME_DELEGATE_REGISTERED,
            data={
                "address": validatorAddress,
                "name": validatorName
            },
            topics=[validatorAddress]
        )
```

#### Vote

Transactions executing this command have:

* `module = MODULE_NAME_POS`
* `command = COMMAND_NAME_VOTE`

##### Parameters

```java
voteTransactionParams = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["votes"],
    "properties": {
        "votes": {
            "type": "array",
            "fieldNumber": 1,
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": ["validatorAddress", "amount"],
                "properties": {
                    "validatorAddress" : {
                        "dataType": "bytes",
                        "length": ADDRESS_LENGTH,
                        "fieldNumber": 1
                    },
                    "amount": {
                        "dataType": "sint64",
                        "fieldNumber": 2
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

##### Verification

The `params` property of a vote transaction is valid if:

* `params.votes` has at most `2 * MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES` elements. The reason of choosing this bound on the size is to allow a voter to unvote all voted validators (which are at most `MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES`) and vote for `MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES` new ones in the same transaction.
* A given `validatorAddress` is included in at most one vote from the list of votes (regardless of the associated amounts).
* For all votes included in `params.votes`, we have:
  * `amount` value is a multiple of `BASE_VOTE_AMOUNT`, i.e., `amount % BASE_VOTE_AMOUNT == 0`. For the Lisk mainchain, where `BASE_VOTE_AMOUNT = 10^9` and `TOKEN_ID_POS = TOKEN_ID_LSK`, this corresponds to multiples of 10 LSK.
  * `amount != 0`.

##### Execution

When executing a vote transaction `trs`, the logic below is followed

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    b = block including trs
    height = b.header.height
    senderAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:ADDRESS_LENGTH] # Derive address from trs.senderPublicKey.

    # Sorting the votes guarantees that we first apply the votes with negative amounts.
    sortedVotes = trs.params.votes ordered by increasing value of amount

    for vote in sortedVotes:
        validatorAddress = vote.validatorAddress

        if validatorStore(validatorAddress) does not exist:
            emitVoteEvent(senderAddress, validatorAddress, vote.amount, VOTE_FAILED_NON_REGISTERED_DELEGATE)
            raise Exception('Invalid vote: no registered validator with the specified address')

                emitVoteEvent(senderAddress, validatorAddress, vote.amount, VOTE_FAILED_INVALID_UNVOTE_PARAMETERS)    
                raise Exception('Invalid unvote: The unvote amount exceeds the voted amount for this validator')

            if len(voterStore(senderAddress).pendingUnlocks) > MAX_NUMBER_PENDING_UNLOCKS:
                emitVoteEvent(senderAddress, validatorAddress, vote.amount, VOTE_FAILED_TOO_MANY_PENDING_UNLOCKS)    
                raise Exception('Sender has reached the maximum number of pending unlocks.')

Here, the [`updateValidatorEligibility` function](#updatevalidatoreligibility) updates the eligible validators substore according to the new weight of the voted validator. The `assignVoteRewards` function is defined in the [reward sharing LIP][lip-reward-sharing]. The calls to this function are needed only in case reward sharing is enabled.

#### Unlock

Transactions executing this command have:

* `module = MODULE_NAME_POS`
* `command = COMMAND_NAME_UNLOCK`

##### Parameters

The `params` property of unlock transactions is empty.

##### Verification

No additional verification is performed for transactions executing this command.

##### Execution

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    senderAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:ADDRESS_LENGTH] # Derive address from trs.senderPublicKey.
    b = block including trs
    height = b.header.height

    for each unlockObject in voterStore(senderAddress).pendingUnlocks:
        # Check if unvoted amount can be unlocked.
        if (isUnlockable(unlockObject, senderAddress, height)
            and isCertificateGenerated(unlockObject)):

            delete unlockObject from voterStore(senderAddress).pendingUnlocks
            Token.unlock(senderAddress, MODULE_NAME_POS, TOKEN_ID_POS, unlockObject.amount)
            # Token module has its own event for successful/failed unlock so no need to add event here.
```

The definition and rationale for the `isCertificateGenerated` function is part of [LIP 0059][lip-0059]. The function `isUnlockable` is defined below. It's logic is the concatenation of the functions `hasWaited` and `isPunished` that are rationalized in [LIP 0023][lip-0023#explicit-unlock-mechanism] and [LIP 0024][lip-0024#rationale] respectively. This function has the following input parameters:

* `unlockObject`: an object with properties `validatorAddress` (the address of the previously voted validator), `amount` (the unvote amount) and `unvoteHeight` (the height of the unvote).
* `senderAddress`: Address of the user sending the unlock transaction.
* `height`: the height of the block including the unlock transaction.

```python
def isUnlockable(unlockObject: UnlockObject, senderAddress: Address, height: uint32) -> bool:
    # First consider the case that validator is not punished.
    validatorAddress = unlockObject.validatorAddress
    lockingPeriod = LOCKING_PERIOD_SELF_VOTES if validatorAddress == senderAddress else LOCKING_PERIOD_VOTES

    # If validator is not punished, normal locking period for votes/selfvotes applies.
    if not isPunished(validatorAddress, height):       
        if height - unlockObject.unvoteHeight < lockingPeriod:
            return False

    else: # Validator is punished.
        let lastPomHeight be the last element of validatorStore(validatorAddress).pomHeights
        # lastPomHeight is also the largest element of the pomHeights array.
        punishmentWindow = PUNISHMENT_WINDOW_SELF_VOTES if validatorAddress == senderAddress else PUNISHMENT_WINDOW_VOTES

        if height – lastPomHeight < punishmentWindow and lastPomHeight < unlockObject.unvoteHeight + lockingPeriod:
            return False

    return True
```

In [LIP 0023][lip-0023] the [locking period][lip-0023#locking-period] for unvoted amounts was set to roughly 5.5 hours (2000 blocks) for the lisk mainchain. The sole protocol change in this LIP is to change this value to roughly 3 days, by setting `LOCKING_PERIOD_VOTES` to 26.000 blocks.    

#### Proof of Misbehavior

Transactions executing this command have:

* `module = MODULE_NAME_POS`
* `command = COMMAND_NAME_POM`

##### Parameters

```java
pomParams = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["header1", "header2"],
    "properties": {
        "header1": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "header2": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 2
        }
    }
}
```

##### Verification

Both properties of the parameters must follow the [block header schema `blockHeaderSchema`][lip-0055#block-header-json-schema] defined in LIP 0055. Validity of this transaction was previously specified in [LIP 0024][lip-0024#validity-of-a-pom-transaction]. For completeness, we include the pseudocode here.

```python
def verify(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    b = block including trs

    header1 = trs.params.header1
    header2 = trs.params.header2

    if header1 or header2 do not satisfy blockHeaderSchema schema:
        raise Exception('Invalid block header.')

    header1 = decode(blockHeaderSchema, header1)
    header2 = decode(blockHeaderSchema, header2)

    if max(abs(header1.height - b.header.height), abs(header2.height - b.header.height))  >= LOCKING_PERIOD_SELF_VOTES:
        raise Exception('Locking period has expired.')
    if isPunished(header1.address, b.header.height):
        raise Exception('Validator is already punished.')
    if validatorStore(header1.address).isBanned:
        raise Exception('Validator is banned.')
    if verifyBlockSignature(header1) == False or verifyBlockSignature(header2) == False:
        raise Exception('Invalid block signature')
    if areHeadersContradicting(header1, header2) == False:
        raise Exception('Block headers are not contradicting.')

```

The [verifyBlockSignature function](#verifyblocksignature) is an internal function defined below. The `areHeadersContradicting` function is defined in [LIP 0058][lip-0058].

##### Execution

Execution of this transaction was previously specified in [LIP 0024][lip-0024#applying-a-pom-transaction]. Here we update the specifications to be integrated in the [state model][lip-0040] used in Lisk.

```python
def execute(trs: Transaction) -> None:
    b = block including trs
    h = b.header.height
    senderAddress = SHA256(trs.senderPublicKey)[:ADDRESS_LENGTH] # Derive address from trs.senderPublicKey.

    header1 = decode(blockHeaderSchema, trs.params.header1)
    header2 = decode(blockHeaderSchema, trs.params.header2)

    punishedAddress = trs.params.header1.generatorAddress

    # Update validator substore.
    validatorStore(punishedAddress).pomHeights.append(h)    

    # Emit event for the validator punishment.
    emitEvent(
            module=MODULE_NAME_POS,
            name=EVENT_NAME_DELEGATE_PUNISHED,
            data={
                "address": validatorAddress
            },
            topics=[validatorAddress]
        )

    # Check if the validator should be banned.
    if len(validatorStore(punishedAddress).pomHeights) == POM_LIMIT_BANNED:
        validatorStore(punishedAddress).isBanned = True
        # Emit event for the validator banning.
        emitEvent(
                module=MODULE_NAME_POS,
                name=EVENT_NAME_DELEGATE_BANNED,
                data={
                    "address": validatorAddress
                },
                topics=[validatorAddress]
            )

    # Assign the PoM reward to the sender of the transaction.
    # The amount is taken from the punished validator account.
    senderReward = min(POM_REWARD, validatorStore(punishedAddress).selfVotes)

    Token.unlock(punishedAddress, MODULE_NAME_POS, TOKEN_ID_POS, senderReward)
    Token.transfer(punishedAddress,
                   senderAddress,
                   TOKEN_ID_POS,
                   senderReward)
    # Update validator and voter substores for punished validator.
    oldWeight = getValidatorWeight(punishedAddress)
    validatorStore(punishedAddress).selfVotes -= senderReward
    validatorStore(punishedAddress).totalVotesReceived -= senderReward
    i = index of element in voterStore(punishedAddress).sentVotes array with item.validatorAddress == punishedAddress
    voterStore(punishedAddress).sentVotes[i].amount -= senderReward

    # Update eligibility of punished validator, based on new weight and potential ban.
    updateValidatorEligibility(punishedAddress, oldWeight)
```

### Internal Functions

#### Round Number and End of Rounds

All blocks (with the exception of the genesis block) are part of a round. The first block after the genesis block is the first block of the first round, and so on. The round length, i.e. the number of blocks in a round, is specified in a configuration file and is denoted `ROUND_LENGTH`. In the block lifecycle, it will be useful to compute the round number to which a block belongs and if the block is the last block of its round. For this, we will use the following functions:

##### roundNumber

This function returns the round number to which the input height belongs.

```python
def roundNumber(h: uint32) -> uint32:
    return ceiling(h - genesisDataStore.height, ROUND_LENGTH)
```

Here, [`ceiling`](#ceiling) is an internal function defined below.

##### isEndOfRound

This function returns a boolean indicating if the input height is at the end of a round or not.

```python
def isEndOfRound(h: uint32) -> bool:
    if (h - genesisDataStore.height) % ROUND_LENGTH == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

#### ceiling

Returns the ceiling of the division between two positive integers.

```python
def ceiling(x: uint32,y: uint32) -> uint32:
    if y == 0:
        raise Exception('Can not divide by 0.')
    return (x+y-1)//y
```

#### getValidatorWeight

This function returns the weight of a given validator (specified by the address).

```python
def getValidatorWeight(address: Address) -> uint64:
    return min(validatorStore(address).selfVotes * FACTOR_SELF_VOTES,
               validatorStore(address).totalVotesReceived)
```

#### shuffleValidatorsList

A function to reorder the list of validators as specified in [LIP 0003][lip-0003].

##### Parameters

The function has the following input parameters in the order given below:

* `validatorList`: An array of objects with of type `ValidatorObject`.
* `randomSeed`: A `SEED_LENGTH`-byte value representing a random seed.

##### Returns

This function returns the input list shuffled using the value of `randomSeed`.

##### Execution

```python
def shuffleValidatorsList(validatorList: list[ValidatorObject], randomSeed: bytes) -> list[ValidatorObject]:
    # Checking pairwise distinct property.
    if validatorList != set(validatorList):
        raise Exception('Validators list invalid (duplicate values detected)')

    roundHash = {}
    for item in validatorList:
        roundHash[item.address] = SHA256(randomSeed + item.address) # Hashing concatenation of randomSeed and address.

    # Reorder the validator list.
    shuffledValidatorList = sort validatorList where item1 < item2 if (roundHash(item1.address) < roundHash(item2.address))
                                 or ((roundHash[item1.address] == roundHash[item1.address]) and item1.address < item2.address)         

    return shuffledValidatorList
```

#### updateValidatorEligibility

A function that updates the eligible validators substore to account for new changes of validator properties.

##### Parameters

The function has the following input parameters:

* `address`: the address of a validator.
* `oldWeight`: the weight of the validator before the eligibility update.

##### Returns

This function does not return.

##### Execution

```python
def updateValidatorEligibility(address: Address, oldWeight: uint64) -> None:
    # Always start by removing the old entry from the eligible validators substore.
    oldKey = oldWeight.to_bytes(8,'big') + address
    if the eligible validator substore contains an entry for key = oldKey:
        remove this entry from the store

    # If the validator is eligible, add an entry to the eligible validators substore.
    weight = getValidatorWeight(address)
    if (weight >= MIN_WEIGHT and validatorStore(address).isBanned == False):

        newKey = weight.to_bytes(8,'big') + address
        lastPomHeight = validatorStore(validatorAddress).pomHeights[-1] if len(validatorStore(validatorAddress).pomHeights) else 0
        create an entry in the eligible validators substore with
            storeKey = newKey,
            storeValue = encode(eligibleValidatorsStoreSchema, {lastPomHeight})
```

#### verifyBlockSignature

Checks whether a block header is validly signed.

##### Execution

```python
def verifyBlockSignature(header: Header) -> bool:
    generatorKey = Validators.getValidatorKeys(header.generatorAddress).generatorKey
    signature = block.header.signature

    # Remove the signature from the block header.
    delete header.signature
    # Serialize the block header without signature.
    serializedUnsignedBlockHeader = encode(unsignedBlockHeaderSchema, header)

    return verifyEd25519(generatorKey, "LSK_BH_", OWN_CHAIN_ID, serializedUnsignedBlockHeader, signature)
```

Here, the function `verifyEd25519` verifies the validity of a signature as specified in [LIP 0062][lip-0062#specification].

#### isValidatorNameValid

Checks whether a given string would be a valid validator name.

##### Execution

```python
def isValidatorNameValid(validatorName: str) -> bool:
    # Name should contain only lower case letters, numbers and symbols `!@$&_.`
    # and should be at least 1 character long and at most MAX_LENGTH_NAME characters long.
    if (not(all(c.isdigit() or c.islower() or c in ['!','@','$','&','_','.'] for c in validatorName))
        or len(validatorName) < 1
        or len(validatorName) > MAX_LENGTH_NAME):

        return False

    return True
```

##### isPunished

This function returns a boolean indicating if a validator is punished at a certain height of not.

```python
def isPunished(address: Address, height: uint32) -> bool:
    if validatorStore(address).pomHeights is empty:
        return False

    let lastPomHeight be the last element of validatorStore(address).pomHeights

    if height <= lastPomHeight + PUNISHMENT_WINDOW_SELF_VOTES:
        return True

    return False
```

#### getActiveValidators

This function computes the set of active validators and their BFT weight based on the input set of eligible validators.

```python
def getActiveValidators(validatorsTwoRoundsAgo: list[EligibleValidatorObject], roundNumber: uint32) -> list[ValidatorObject]:
    initRounds = genesisDataStore.initRounds
    initValidators = genesisDataStore.initValidators

    # During the first NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES rounds after the bootstrap period
    # the initial validators are only partly replaced by elected validators.
    # During this phase, there are no selected standby validators.
    if roundNumber < initRounds + NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES:
        nbrInitValidators = initRounds + NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES - roundNumber
        nbrElectedValidators = NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES - nbrInitValidators

        # In the definition below, recall that validatorsTwoRoundsAgo is sorted by validator weight.
        electedValidatorAddresses = [item.address for item in validatorsTwoRoundsAgo[:nbrElectedValidators]]

        remainingInitValidators = [address for address in initValidators if address not in electedValidatorAddresses]

        # Concatenation of elected validators and remaining initial validators.
        activeValidatorAddresses = electedValidatorAddresses + remainingInitValidators[:nbrInitValidators]
        activeValidators = [{"address": item, "bftWeight": 1 } for item in activeValidatorAddresses]

    else:
        # If validatorsTwoRoundsAgo contains less than NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES entries
        # there will be less than NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES active validators.
        # Recall that validatorsTwoRoundsAgo is sorted by validator weight.
        activeValidators = [{"address": item.address, "bftWeight": ceiling(item.weight, WEIGHT_SCALE_FACTOR) } for item in validatorsTwoRoundsAgo[:NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES]]
        # Apply capping in weights if necessary.
        if len(activeValidators) >= ceiling(10000, MAX_BFT_WEIGHT_CAP):
            activeValidators = capWeights(activeValidators, MAX_BFT_WEIGHT_CAP)

    return activeValidators
```

#### getSelectedStandbyValidators

This function selects the standby validators for a round and returns them together with their BFT weight.

```python
def getSelectedStandbyValidators(standbyValidators: list[EligibleValidatorObject], height: uint32) -> list[ValidatorObject]:
    # We now compute the randomness used for selecting the first standby validator.
    randomSeed1 = random.getRandomBytes(
        height +1 - (ROUND_LENGTH*3)//2,
        ROUND_LENGTH
    )

    if NUMBER_STANDBY_DELEGATES == 2 and len(standbyValidators) >=2:
        randomSeed2 = random.getRandomBytes(
            height +1 - 2*ROUND_LENGTH,
            ROUND_LENGTH
        )
        selectedStandbyValidators = select 2 address from standbyValidators
                                   as specified in LIP 0022, using the seeds randomSeed1 and randomSeed2
    elif NUMBER_STANDBY_DELEGATES >= 1 and len(standbyValidators) >= 1:
        selectedStandbyValidators = select 1 address from standbyValidators
                                   as specified in LIP 0022, using the seed randomSeed1
    else: # No standby validators.
        selectedStandbyValidators = empty

    return [{"address": item.address, "bftWeight": 0} for item in selectedStandbyValidators]
```

#### capWeights

This function caps the values of a sorted array to make sure that no element has value more than a certain percentage of the total value.

##### Parameters

* `validatorList`: An array of objects of type `ValidatorObject` array of integers, sorted in decreasing order of `weight`.
* `capValue`: Specifies the percentage in which the values are capped. Takes values from 0 - 10000 corresponding to double decimal precision integers which can be obtained by dividing it by 100, i.e., 1000 means 10%.

```python
def capWeights(validatorList: list[ValidatorObject], capValue: uint32) -> list[ValidatorObject]:
    if validatorList.sort(reverse = True, key = lambda y:y.bftWeight) != validatorList: # List should be ordered in decreasing order of weight.
        raise Exception('List is not sorted in decreasing order.')
    if capValue == 0 or capValue >= 10000:
        raise Exception('Invalid value for capping.')

    maxNumCappedElements = ceiling(10000, capValue) - 1
    if len(validatorList) <= maxNumCappedElements:
        raise Exception('List size not enough to apply capping with specified value.')

    partialSum = 0
    for i in range(maxNumCappedElements + 1, len(validatorList)):
        partialSum += validatorList[i].bftWeight

    for i in range(maxNumCappedElements, 0, -1):
       partialSum += validatorList[i].bftWeight
       cappedWeightRemainingElements = (capValue * partialSum) // (10000 - (capValue * i))
       if cappedWeightRemainingElements < validatorList[i-1].bftWeight:
           for k in range(i):
              validatorList[k].bftWeight = cappedWeightRemainingElements
           break

    return validatorList
```

The idea of the function above is that for the `validatorList` with elements in descending order of `bftWeight`, then you want the following equation to hold for element `i`:

```
x <= (capValue / 10000) ( i * x + sum( [validatorList[k].bftWeight for k in range(i,len(validatorList))])
```

Here `x` is the BFT weight at which the elements `validatorList[0].bftWeight, ..., validatorList[i-1].bftWeight` are capped. Solving the above equation for `x` yields the value of `cappedWeightRemainingElements` in the code. Note that if
`cappedWeightRemainingElements > validatorList[i-1].bftWeight`, then you do not need to cap `validatorList[i-1].bftWeight` and can reduce the index `i` by 1.

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

#### Genesis State Initialization

During the genesis state initialization stage, the following steps are executed. If any step fails, the block is discarded and has no further effect.

Let `genesisBlockAssetBytes` be the `data` bytes included in the block assets for the PoS module and let `genesisBlockAssetObject` be the deserialization of `genesisBlockAssetBytes` according to the `genesisPoSStoreSchema` schema, given above.

* Initial checks on the properties of `genesisBlockAssetObject`:
  * `genesisBlockAssetObject` should satisfy the [`genesisPoSStoreSchema` schema](#genesis-assets-schema).
  * Across elements of the `validators` array, all `address` values must be unique, all `name` values must also be unique.
  * For all elements of the `validators` array, `name` values must satisfy `isValidatorNameValid(name) == True`.
  * For all elements of the `validators` array, `commission` values must satisfy `commission <= 10000`.
  * For all elements of the `validators` array, `lastCommissionIncreaseHeight` values must satisfy `lastCommissionIncreaseHeight <=` block header height of the genesis block.
  * For all elements of the `validators` array, the `sharingCoefficients` array must be ordered in lexicographic order of `tokenID`.
  * Across elements of the `voters` array, all `address` values must be unique.
  * For all elements of the `voters` array:
    * Either `sentVotes != []` or `pendingUnlocks != []`.
    * All `amounts` properties in elements of the `sentVotes` or the `pendingUnlocks` arrays must be non-zero.
    * Across elements of the `sentVotes` array, all `validatorAddress` values must be unique.
    * For each element `sentVote` in the `sentVotes` array, there is an element `validator` in the `validators` array with `validator.address == sentVote.validatorAddress`. Moreover, for each `item` in `sentVote.voteSharingCoefficients` array, there must be an entry `elem` in the `validator.sharingCoefficients` array such that `item.tokenID == elem.tokenID` and `item.coefficient <= elem.coefficient`.
    * For each element `sentVote` in the `sentVotes` array, the `voteSharingCoefficients` must be ordered in lexicographic order of `tokenID`.
    * For each element `sentVote` in the `sentVotes` array, for each item in `voteSharingCoefficients` array  must be ordered in lexicographic order of `tokenID`.
    * `sentVotes` has size is at most `MAX_NUMBER_SENT_VOTES`.
    * `sentVotes` must be in lexicographic order of `validatorAddress`.
    * `pendingUnlocks` has size is at most `MAX_NUMBER_PENDING_UNLOCKS`.
    * `pendingUnlocks` must be ordered by lexicographical order of `validatorAddress`, ties then broken by increasing `amount`, ties finally broken by increasing `unvoteHeight`.
    * For each element `pendingUnlock` in the `pendingUnlocks` array, there is an element `validator` in the `validators` array with `validator.address == pendingUnlock.validatorAddress`.
    * For each element `pendingUnlock` in the `pendingUnlocks` array, `unvoteHeight` value must satisfy `unvoteHeight <`block header height of the genesis block.
  * All values of the `genesisData.initValidators` array must be unique and must be equal to `validator.address` for a `validator` element of `validators`.
  * The `genesisData.initValidators` array must have length equal to `NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES` and be in lexicographical order.
  * `genesisData.initRounds` must be at least `MIN_INIT_ROUNDS`.
* For each entry `validator` in `genesisBlockAssetObject.validators`, create an entry in the validator substore with:
  ```python
  totalVotesReceived = 0
  for voter in genesisBlockAssetObject.voters:
      for sentVote in voter.sentVotes:
          if sentVote.validatorAddress == validator.address:
              totalVotesReceived += sentVote.amount
              if voter.address == validator.address:
                  selfVotes = sentVote.amount

  validatorState = {
      "name": validator.name,
      "totalVotesReceived": totalVotesReceived,
      "selfVotes": selfVotes,
      "lastGeneratedHeight": validator.lastGeneratedHeight,
      "isBanned": validator.isBanned,
      "pomHeights": validator.pomHeights,
      "consecutiveMissedBlocks": validator.consecutiveMissedBlocks,
      "commission" : validator.commission,
      "lastCommissionIncreaseHeight": validator.lastCommissionIncreaseHeight,
      "sharingCoefficients": validator.sharingCoefficients  
  }
  storeKey = validator.address
  storeValue = encode(validatorStoreSchema, validatorState)
  ```

  Further, for every entry `validator` in `genesisBlockAssetObject.validators`, also create an entry in the name substore with:

  ```python
  validatorState = {
      "validatorAddress": validator.address
  }

  storeKey = validator.name utf8-encoded
  storeValue = encode(nameStoreSchema, validatorState)
  ```

* For each entry `voter` in `genesisBlockAssetObject.voters`, create an entry in the voter substore with:
  ```python

  voterState = {
      "sentVotes": voter.sentVotes,
      "pendingUnlocks": voter.pendingUnlocks
  }
  storeKey = voter.address
  storeValue =  encode(voterStoreSchema, voterState)
  ```
* Create an entry in the genesis data substore with:
  ```python
  genesisState = {
      "height": block header height of the genesis block,
      "initRounds": genesisBlockAssetObject.genesisData.initRounds,
      "initValidators": genesisBlockAssetObject.genesisData.initValidators
  }

  storeKey = EMPTY_BYTES
  storeValue = encode(genesisDataStoreSchema, genesisState)
  ```
* Create an entry in the previous timestamp substore with:
  ```python
  timestampState = {
      "timestamp": block header height of the genesis block
  }  
  storeKey = EMPTY_BYTES
  storeValue = encode(previousTimestampStoreSchema, timestampState)
  ```

#### Genesis State Finalization

To finalize the state of the genesis block the following logic is executed.  If any step fails, the block is discarded and has no further effect.

As in the previous point, let `genesisBlockAssetBytes` be the `data` bytes included in the block assets for the PoS module and let `genesisBlockAssetObject` be the deserialization of `genesisBlockAssetBytes` according to the `genesisPoSStoreSchema` schema, given above. Moreover, let `b` be the genesis block. Then:

```python
# Register all validators in the Validators module.
# For the snapshot block for the migration from Lisk Core 3 to Lisk Core 4 on
# Lisk mainnet, apply a special rule. This must be done as validators in
# this snapshot block do not have a BLS key.
if the chain is the mainchain and b is the snapshot block for the migration:
    for validator in genesisBlockAssetObject.validators:
        Validators.registerValidatorWithoutBLSKey(
            validator.address,
            validator.generatorKey
        )

else:
# For any other genesis block, register validators with a BLS key.
    for validator in genesisBlockAssetObject.validators:
        Validators.registerValidatorKeys(
            validator.address,
            validator.proofOfPossession,
            validator.generatorKey,
            validator.blsKey
        )
        updateValidatorEligibility(validator.address, 0)

# Check that all sentVotes and pendingUnlocks correspond to locked tokens.
for address a key of the voter substore:
    if there exists an entry in validator substore with key == address:
        if Token.getLockedAmount(address, MODULE_NAME_POS, TOKEN_ID_POS) < getLockedVotedAmount(address):
            raise Exception('Locked amount is incompatible with specified votes.')
    else:
        # For non-validators, the only reason for locking is voting, so the values should match precisely.
        if Token.getLockedAmount(address, MODULE_NAME_POS, TOKEN_ID_POS) != getLockedVotedAmount(address):
            raise Exception('Locked values do not match.')

# Set the initial validators.
# Recall that initValidator is always in lexicographical order.
validatorList = [
    {"address": address, "bftWeight": 1}
    for address in genesisBlockAssetObject.genesisData.initValidators
]

# Compute the thresholds for the BFT consensus protocol.
aggregateBFTWeight = 0
for validator in validatorList:
    aggregateBFTWeight += validator.bftWeight

```

### Block Processing

The following steps are executed as part of the (non-genesis) block processing, see [LIP 0055][lip-0055] for details.

#### After Transactions Execution

After the transactions in a block `b` are executed, the properties related to missed blocks are updated according to [Validator Productivity][lip-0023#validator-productivity]. This logic is recapitulated below:

```python
def afterTransactionsExecute(b: Block) -> None:
    height = b.header.height

    # previousTimestamp is the value in the previous timestamp substore.
    missedBlocks = Validators.getGeneratorsBetweenTimestamps(previousTimestamp, b.header.timestamp)

    for address in missedBlocks:
        validatorStore(address).consecutiveMissedBlocks += missedBlocks[address]

        # The below rule was introduced in LIP 0023.
        if (validatorStore(address).consecutiveMissedBlocks > FAIL_SAFE_MISSED_BLOCKS
            and height - validatorStore(address).lastGeneratedHeight > FAIL_SAFE_INACTIVE_WINDOW):
            validatorStore(address).isBanned = True
            updateValidatorEligibility(address,getValidatorWeight(address))

    validatorStore(b.header.generatorAddress).consecutiveMissedBlocks = 0
    validatorStore(b.header.generatorAddress).lastGeneratedHeight = height

    # Update previousTimestamp substore.
    previousTimestamp = b.header.timestamp

    if isEndOfRound(height) == False:
        return

    # Block b is an end-of-round block. Need to update snapshot and select validators for next round.
    # This must be done after the properties related to missed blocks are updated.

    # Punished validators are excluded from the snapshot.
    eligibleValidators = [
        {"address": key[-ADDRESS_LENGTH:], "weight": int.from_bytes(key[:-ADDRESS_LENGTH], 'big')}
        for key a substore key of the eligible validators substore if
        eligibleValidatorsStore(key) < height - PUNISHMENT_WINDOW_SELF_VOTES or
        eligibleValidatorsStore(key) == 0
    ] ordered by weight, ties broken by reverse lexicographical ordering of address
    # Notice that the keys in the substore naturally have the right ordering
    # when being read from the end to the beginning of the store.

    roundNumber = roundNumber(height)

    snapshotState = {
            "validatorWeightSnapshot": eligibleValidators
        }
    create an entry in the snapshot substore with
        storeKey = roundNumber.to_bytes(4,'big'),
        storeValue = encode(snapshotStoreSchema, snapshotState)
    delete any entries from the snapshot substore snapshotStore(x) for x <= roundNumber-3

    # Updates to Validators and BFT weights are only done after the bootstrap period.
    if roundNumber <= genesisDataStore.initRounds:
        return

    # Calculate the active validators based on the snapshot taken two rounds ago.
    validatorsTwoRoundsAgo = [item for item in snapshotStore(roundNumber-2)]
    validatorList = getActiveValidators(validatorsTwoRoundsAgo, roundNumber)

    # Select standby validators if relevant.
    if roundNumber > initRounds + NUMBER_ACTIVE_DELEGATES:
        standbyValidators = [validator for validator in validatorsTwoRoundsAgo
                            if validator["address"] not in validatorList]

        selectedStandbyValidators = getSelectedStandbyValidators(standbyValidators, height)
        # Add selected standby validators to validators.
        validatorList += selectedStandbyValidators

    # If there are no eligible validators, validatorList is empty.
    # In this case, the BFT parameters and validator list are not updated.
    if validatorList is empty:
        return

    # Compute the thresholds for the BFT consensus protocol.
    aggregateBFTWeight = 0
    for validator in validatorList:
        aggregateBFTWeight += validator.bftWeight

    precommitThreshold = (2 * aggregateBFTWeight) // 3 + 1
    certificateThreshold = precommitThreshold

    # Random seed to shuffle validators.
    randomSeed = random.getRandomBytes(
        height +1 - (ROUND_LENGTH*3)//2,
        ROUND_LENGTH
    )
    shuffledValidatorList = shuffleValidatorsList(validatorList, randomSeed)

    Validators.setValidatorParams(precommitThreshold, certificateThreshold, shuffledValidatorList)
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new store interface for the PoS module, which in turn will become part of the state tree and will be authenticated by the state root. As such, it will induce a hardfork.
