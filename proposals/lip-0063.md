## Abstract

This proposal defines the configuration of Lisk Core v4, including the selection of modules and the choice of some configurable constants. Moreover, it defines the migration process from Lisk Core v3 to Lisk Core v4\. As for the previous hard fork, a snapshot block is used that contains a snapshot of the state. This snapshot block is then treated like a genesis block by Lisk Core v4 nodes. In contrast to the previous hard fork, the existing block and transaction history is not discarded.

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

This LIP is motivated by two points. The first is that the Lisk SDK v6 introduces several new configurable settings. This includes the set of existing modules that can or even must be registered. But also some new constants that must be specified for each chain. Thus, these configurations must be specified for Lisk Core v4 as well which shall be done within this LIP.

The second point is the migration from Lisk Core v3 to Lisk Core v4, for which a process must be defined. This shall also be done within this LIP.

## Specification

### Constants

The following table defines some constants that will be used in the remainder of this document.

This value will be used for every delegate account in the snapshot block.

### Mainnet Migration

#### Process

![Overview of migration process](lip-0063/migration_graphic.png)

_Figure 1: Overview of the migration process. Elements in blue are created by Lisk Core v3, including the state snapshot. The element in yellow - the snapshot block - is created by the migrator tool. Elements in green are created by Lisk Core v4._

The migration from Lisk Core v3 to Lisk Core v4, also depicted in Figure 1, is performed as follows:

1. Nodes run Lisk Core v3, where the following steps are done:
    1. Once a block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` is processed, a snapshot of the state is derived, which we denote by `STATE_SNAPSHOT`. If this block is reverted and a new block for this height is processed, then `STATE_SNAPSHOT` needs to be computed again.
    2. Nodes continue processing blocks until the block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` is final.
    3. Once the block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` is final, nodes can stop forging and processing new blocks. All blocks with a height larger than or equal to `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` are discarded, even if they are finalized.
2. Nodes compute a snapshot block as defined [below](#snapshot-block) using a _migrator tool_ and store it locally.
3. Nodes start to run Lisk Core v4, where the steps described in the section [Starting Lisk Core v4](#starting-lisk-core-4) are executed.
4. Once the timeslot of the snapshot block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` is passed, the first round following the new protocol starts.

##### Starting Lisk Core v4

When Lisk Core v4 is started for the first time, the following steps are performed:

1. Get the snapshot block (the one for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1`):
    1. Check if the snapshot block for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` exists locally. If yes, fetch this block. If not, stop the initialization here.
2. Process the snapshot block as described in [LIP 0060](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0060.md).
3. Check if all blocks between heights `HEIGHT_PREVIOUS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK` and `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` (inclusive) from Lisk Core v3 can be found locally. If yes:
    1. Fetch these blocks from highest to lowest height. Each block is validated using [minimal validation steps as defined below](#minimal-validation-of-core-v3-blocks). If this validation step passes, the block and its transactions are persisted in the database.
    2. Skip steps 4 and 5.
4. Fetch all blocks between heights `HEIGHT_PREVIOUS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK + 1` and `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` (inclusive) via peer-to-peer network from highest to lowest height. Each block is validated using [minimal validation steps as defined below](#minimal-validation-of-core-v3-blocks). If this validation passes, the block along with its transactions is persisted in the database.
5. The snapshot block for the height `HEIGHT_PREVIOUS_SNAPSHOT_BLOCK` is downloaded from a server. The URL for the source can be configured. When downloaded, it is validated using [minimal validation steps as defined below](#minimal-validation-of-core-v3-blocks). If this validation step passes, the block is persisted in the database.

The steps 3 to 5 from above could run in the background with low priority.

Due to step 1.1, it is a requirement to run Lisk Core v3 and the migrator tool before running Lisk Core v4\. However, nodes starting some time after the migration may fetch the snapshot block and its preceding blocks without running Lisk Core v3 and migrator tool, as described in the following subsection.

###### Fetching Block History and Snapshot Block without Running Lisk Core v3

Once the snapshot block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` is final, a new version of Lisk Core v4 that has the block ID of this snapshot block hard-coded can be released. In the following, we denote this version by Lisk Core v4+. When Lisk Core v4+ starts for the first time, the same steps as described above are executed, except that step 1 is replaced by the following:

1. Get the snapshot block (the one for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1`):
    1. Check if the snapshot block for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` exists locally. If yes:
        1. Fetch this block.
        2. Verify that the block ID of this block is matching with the hard-coded block ID of the snapshot block. If yes, skip step ii. If not, continue with step ii.
    2. The snapshot block for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` is downloaded from a server. The URL for the source can be configured in Lisk Core v4+. Once downloaded, it first must be verified that the block ID of this block matches with the hard-coded block ID of the snapshot block. If not, stop the initialization here (the process should be repeated, but the node operator should specify a new server to download the snapshot block from).

Note that once the snapshot block for height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1` is processed, the node should start its regular block synchronization, i.e., fetching the blocks with height larger than `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1`. The steps 4 to 5 from above could run in the background with low priority.

###### Minimal Validation of Core v3 Blocks

A block created by Lisk Core v3, i.e., a block with a height between `HEIGHT_PREVIOUS_SNAPSHOT` and `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` (inclusive) is validated as follows:

- Verify that the block follows the [`block schema`](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0029.md#deserialization) defined in [LIP 0029](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0029.md).
- Compute the block ID as defined in [LIP 0029](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0029.md#block-id) and verify that it is equal to the `previousBlockID` property of the child block.
- Verify that the transactions in the payload yield the [transaction root](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0032.md#specification) provided in the block header.

If any of the steps above fails, the block is invalid.

#### Snapshot Block

The snapshot block `b` is constructed in accordance with the definition of _[genesis block](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0060.md#genesis-block)_ in LIP 0060\. The details for the `header` and `assets` property are specified in the following subsections.

##### Header

Let `a` be the block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT`. Then the following points define how `b.header` is constructed:

- `b.header.version = SNAPSHOT_BLOCK_VERSION`
- `b.header.timestamp = a.header.timestamp + SNAPSHOT_TIME_GAP`
- `b.header.height = HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT + 1`
- `b.header.previousBlockID = blockID(a)`
- all other block header properties must be as specified in [LIP 0060](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0060.md#validation-2)

##### Assets

From the [registered modules](#modules), the following ones add an entry to `b.assets`:

- Legacy module
- Token module
- Auth module
- DPoS module

How these modules construct their entry for the `assets` property is defined in the next subsections. The verification of their entries is defined in the _Genesis Block Processing_ sections of the respective module LIPs. Note that once all modules add their entries to `b.assets`, this array [must be sorted by increasing value of moduleID](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0055.md#validation-1).

In the following, let `accountsState` be the key-value store of the accounts state of `STATE_SNAPSHOT` computed as described [above](#process). That means, for a byte array `addr` representing an address, `accountsState[addr]` is the corresponding account object following the account schema defined in [LIP 0030](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0030.md). Moreover, let `accounts` be the array that contains all values of `accountsState` for which the key is a 20-byte address sorted in lexicographical order of their `address` property. Correspondingly, let `legacyAccounts` be the array that contains all values of `accountsState` for which the key is an 8-byte address sorted in lexicographical order of their `address` property.

###### Assets Entry for Legacy Module

Let `genesisLegacyStoreSchema` be as defined in [LIP 0050](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/aebeecc40447e4229f14fc641fb11527270dfbb5/proposals/lip-0050.md#genesis-state-initialization). The `assets` entry for the legacy module is added by the logic defined in the function `addLegacyModuleEntry` in the following pseudo code:

```python
def addLegacyModuleEntry():
    legacyObj = {}
    legacyObj.accounts = []
    for every account in legacyAccounts:
        userObj = {}
        userObj.address = account.address
        userObj.balance = account.token.balance
        legacyObj.accounts.append(userObj)
    data = serialization of legacyObj using genesisLegacyStoreSchema
    append {"module": MODULE_NAME_LEGACY, "data": data} to b.assets
```

###### Assets Entry for Token Module

Let `genesisTokenStoreSchema` be as defined in [LIP 0051](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/aebeecc40447e4229f14fc641fb11527270dfbb5/proposals/lip-0051.md#genesis-assets-schema). The `assets` entry for the token module is added by the logic defined in the function `addTokenModuleEntry` in the following pseudo code:

```python
def addTokenModuleEntry():
    tokenObj = {}
    tokenObj.userSubstore = createUserSubstoreArray()
    tokenObj.supplySubstore = createSupplySubstoreArray()
    tokenObj.escrowSubstore = []
    tokenObj.availableLocalIDSubstore = {}
    tokenObj.availableLocalIDSubstore.nextAvailableLocalID = nextLexicographicalOrder(LOCAL_ID_LSK)
    # Where the function nextLexicographicalOrder returns the next byte value, in lexicographical order
    # this is equivalent to doing localID + 1 if the byte value is viewed as a big endian integer.
    data = serialization of tokenObj using genesisTokenStoreSchema
    append {"module": MODULE_NAME_TOKEN, "data": data} to b.assets

def createUserSubstoreArray():
    userSubstore = []
    for every account in accounts:
        if account.address != ADDRESS_LEGACY_RESERVE:
            userObj = {}
            userObj.address = account.address
            userObj.tokenID = TOKEN_ID_LSK
            userObj.availableBalance = account.token.balance
            userObj.lockedBalances = getLockedBalances(account)
            userSubstore.append(userObj)
    # append the legacy reserve account separately
    userSubstore.append(createLegacyReserveAccount())
    sort userSubstore in the ascending order of (userObj.address + userObj.tokenID)
    return userSubstore

def createLegacyReserveAccount():
    legacyReserveAccount = account in accounts with account.address == ADDRESS_LEGACY_RESERVE
    isEmpty = legacyReserveAmount is empty
    legacyReserve = {}
    legacyReserve.address = ADDRESS_LEGACY_RESERVE
    legacyReserve.tokenID = TOKEN_ID_LSK
    legacyReserve.availableBalance = isEmpty ? 0 : legacyReserveAccount.token.balance
    legacyReserveAmount = 0
    for every account in legacyAccounts:
        legacyReserveAmount += account.token.balance
    lockedBalances = isEmpty ? [] : getLockedBalances(legacyReserveAccount)
    legacyReserve.lockedBalances = lockedBalances.append({"module": MODULE_NAME_LEGACY, "amount": legacyReserveAmount})
    return legacyReserve

def getLockedBalances(account):
    amount = 0
    for vote in account.dpos.sentVotes:
        amount += vote.amount
    for unlockingObj in account.dpos.unlocking:
        amount += unlockingObj.amount
    if amount > 0:
        return [{"module": MODULE_NAME_DPOS, "amount": amount}]
    else:
        return []

def createSupplySubstoreArray():
    totalLSKSupply = 0
    for every account in accounts:
        totalLSKSupply += account.token.balance
        lockedBalances = getLockedBalances(account)
        if lockedBalances is not empty:
            totalLSKSupply += lockedBalances[0].amount
    LSKSupply = {"tokenID": TOKEN_ID_LSK, "totalSupply": totalLSKSupply}
    return [LSKSupply]

###### Assets Entry for Auth Module

Let `genesisAuthStoreSchema` be as defined in [LIP 0041](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/aebeecc40447e4229f14fc641fb11527270dfbb5/proposals/lip-0041.md#genesis-state-initialization). The `assets` entry for the auth module is added by the logic defined in the function `addAuthModuleEntry` in the following pseudo code:

```python
def addAuthModuleEntry():
    authDataSubstore = []
    for every account in accounts:
        authObj = {}
        authObj.numberOfSignatures = account.keys.numberOfSignatures
        # sort the keys in the lexicographical order if needed
        authObj.mandatoryKeys = account.keys.mandatoryKeys.sort()
        authObj.optionalKeys = account.keys.optionalKeys.sort()
        authObj.nonce = account.sequence.nonce
        entry = {"address": account.address, "authAccount": authObj}

## Rationale

### Keeping Lisk Core v3 Block History

The decision to discard the block history of Lisk Mainnet at the hard fork from Lisk Core v2 to Lisk Core v3 was considered as rather disadvantageous. One reason is that the entire transaction history of an account can not be retrieved anymore from a node running Lisk Core v3\. Therefore, the block history of blocks created with Lisk Core v3 shall be kept on Lisk Core v4 nodes.

#### Getting the Lisk Core v3 Block History

In order to keep the implementation of Lisk Core v4 as clean as possible, Lisk Core v4 cannot process Lisk Core v3 blocks, but only ensure their integrity. This is, however, sufficient for maintaining the Lisk Core v3 block history and guaranteeing the immutability of this block history.

Once Lisk Core v4 processes the snapshot block, it can fetch the whole Lisk Core v3 block history, where this is done from the highest to the lowest height. This allows that each block can be validated by simply checking if its block ID matches with the `previousBlockID` property of the child block, and if the payload matches with the `transactionRoot` property. Thus, almost no protocol rules related to Lisk Core v3 must be implemented which keeps the implementation clean. The Lisk Core v3 history can be fetched from a database created by Lisk Core v3 on the same machine or from the peer-to-peer network. Note that the first Lisk Core v3 block - the snapshot block of the previous migration - poses an exception as this one is either [downloaded from a server](#fetching-snapshot-blocks) or fetched from a database created by Lisk Core v3 on the same machine.

### Fetching Snapshot Blocks

The snapshot block created for this hard fork as well as for the [one used for the previous hard fork](https://lisk.observer/block/abdea6dfe5941922d958d1f1dc1d2f97249723b8852325334e55b73e92584191) is not shared via peer-to-peer network due to their large size. Instead, they are either downloaded from a server or must be found locally.

#### Initial Version of Lisk Core v4

The initial version of Lisk Core v4 can not download the snapshot block for this hard fork from a server because it could not validate the block. Instead, it must find the snapshot block locally on the same machine. This requires that the snapshot block must be created using a migrator tool on the same node, which in turn requires that the node runs the latest patched version of Lisk Core v3 until the block at height `HEIGHT_SNAPSHOT` is final.

#### Later Versions of Lisk Core v4

Once the snapshot block is final, a patched version of Lisk Core v4 will be released in which the block ID of the snapshot block is hard coded. This allows to validate a downloaded snapshot block by simply checking its block ID.

#### Downloading from Server

The URL can be configured. By default, the URL points to a server of the Lisk Foundation. The snapshot block of this hard fork is validated by checking that its block ID matches the hard coded block ID in the patched version of Lisk Core v4\. The snapshot block of the previous migration is validated by checking that its block ID matches with the `previousBlockID` property of its child block (see also [here](#getting-the-lisk-core-3-block-history)). Hence, there are no security concerns by downloading them from even a non-trusted server. Users can nevertheless configure their node to download it from a server of their choice. The snapshot blocks could be provided by any user. This may also be helpful in situations where the Lisk Foundation server is down.

### Assigning Generator Key to Validator Accounts

In the protocol used by Lisk Core v4, each validator needs a [generator key](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0044.md#generator-key) in order to generate blocks. Moreover, the DPoS module expects that each validator account has such a key specified in the snapshot block. Otherwise, the snapshot block is invalid (see [here](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md#genesis-state-initialization)). Therefore, it is aimed to use the existing public keys of the validator accounts as the initial generator keys in the snapshot block. However, the public key does not belong to the [account state](https://lisk.com/documentation/lisk-sdk/protocol/accounts.html) anymore with Lisk Core v3\. For this reason, the whole block history from the previous snapshot block onwards is scanned for public keys of registered validators. The found keys are used as generator keys in the snapshot block. Validator accounts for which no public key was found get an "invalid" public key assigned, i.e., one for which every signature validation will fail. The specific value is discussed in the [following subsection](#invalid-ed25519-public-key). Those validators should send an [update generator key](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md#update-generator-key) transaction as soon as possible once Lisk Core v4 is used, ideally within the [bootstrap period](#bootstrap-period). Otherwise, those validators can still be active validators, but are not able to generate valid blocks as they cannot create [valid block signatures](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0055.md#signature). In the worst case, this may lead to banning which happens after 50 blocks in a row are missed.

To avoid the need to send an _updated generator key_ right after the hard fork, registered validators that did not forge a block and did not send a transaction in the Lisk Core v3 history could simply send a transaction any time before the hard fork. Then the sender public key of this transaction will be set as the generator key as described above. Nevertheless, every validator is encouraged to perform an _update generator key_ with a generator key different from the public key used for transaction signatures eventually. This is due to [security benefits](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0044.md#generator-key) added by the concept of generator keys.

#### Invalid Ed25519 Public Key

The chosen value for the Ed25519 public key for which every signature validation should fail, `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`, is the little endian encoding of 2<sup>256</sup>-1\. As described in the first point of the [decoding section](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.3) of RFC 8032, decoding this value fails because `y`-coordinate value 2<sup>255</sup>-1 is bigger than `p` = 2<sup>255</sup>-19 (see [the notations section](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032#section-2) for more information on little-endian encoding in EdDSA protocol). This in turn results in signature verification failure as described in the first point of the [verification section](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.7), regardless of the message and the signature.

### Assigning BLS Key to Validator Accounts

In blockchains created with Lisk SDK v6, one needs to [register](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0044.md#registervalidatorkeys) a [valid BLS key](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0038.md#public-key-registration-and-proof-of-possession) in order to become a validator. This results in an exception for Lisk Core v4 as the existing validators do not have valid BLS key right after the hard fork. Since the DPoS module expects that each validator account has a BLS key and a proof of possession set in the snapshot block (see [here](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md#genesis-state-initialization)), this will be done by assigning a fixed public key for which signature validation will always fail along with a dummy value for the proof of possession. This proof of possession will never be evaluated as the DPoS and the validator module handle an exception for this particular case (see [here](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md#genesis-state-finalization) and [here](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0044.md#registervalidatorwithoutblskey)). Every validator should then register a valid BLS key via a _[register BLS key](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0050.md#register-bls-key)_ transaction, ideally within the [bootstrap period](#bootstrap-period) described below.

### Bootstrap Period

There will be a bootstrap period in which a fixed set of delegates will constitute the set of active delegates. This period will last for one week assuming no missed blocks. This is done by setting the [`initRounds`](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md#genesis-assets-schema) property in the snapshot block to the corresponding value, which is given by `DPOS_INIT_ROUNDS`. The reason to have this period is that the DPoS module selects delegates only with a valid BLS key outside of the bootstrap period (there will be an update to [LIP 0057](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0057.md) that adapts the delegate selection in this way). Thus, without a bootstrap period, the DPoS module could not select any delegates right after the hard fork which would result in a stop of the chain.

The bootstrap period allows each delegate to submit a _[register BLS key](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0050.md#register-bls-key)_ transaction in a sufficiently large time window. The expectation is that most delegates have a valid BLS key after the bootstrap period. In the unexpected case that there are less than 101 non-banned delegates with a BLS key, the DPoS module would simply select a smaller set of delegates that get the block slots of a round assigned round robin.
