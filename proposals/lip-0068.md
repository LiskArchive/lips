## Abstract

This LIP defines a new schema to be used to serialize transactions. The main change is to replace module and command identifiers by the corresponding names, which are of type string. This LIP also updates the terminology used for transaction and transaction properties.

## Copyright

This LIP is licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Motivation

The Lisk protocol handles identifiers for transactions, modules, commands, and many more. In many of those cases such as modules and commands there is also a name property, which is of type string and is set to some intuitive value (e.g., "token" module, "transfer" command). In the current protocol, such objects are referenced using their identifiers and their names have an auxiliary role. This is not so convenient for users and developers, since they have to memorize the (non-intuitive) identifier values. Merging those two properties and identifying modules and commands using their name provides a much better user/developer experience.

## Rationale

### Simplifying Identification

The type identifiers in the Lisk protocol are of type `uint32` or of type `bytes`. In both cases, they are set to a non-intuitive value which has to be memorized by users and developers. As the ecosystem grows and more functionalities are added, especially with the intoduction of interoperability, the number of values that have to be memorized gets quite large, making the identification system quite impractical (and potentially error-prone). On the other hand, for each component (modules, commands, events, etc.) there is a much more intuitive parameter: its name. Switching identifiers to those names (and removing the old identifiers) makes the whole user and developer experience easier and less error-prone.

Therefore, for the cases where removing the old identifiers does not introduce any significant challenge in the ecosystem, it is plausible to proceed to this switch and use names as identifiers. This is the case for modules, commands and events.

### Changes Compared to LIP 0028

The previous transaction schema was defined in [LIP 0028][lip-0028]. Here we define the following changes:

**New property names:** All properties in the proposed transaction schema are equivalent to the ones defined in [LIP 0028][lip-0028]. The only changes are the replacement of identifiers by the corresponding names and the update of terminology according to the [LIP 0069][lip-0069] (renaming a module asset to a command and a transaction `asset` property to `params`). Overall, `moduleID` is replaced by `module`, `assetID` is replaced by `command` and `asset` is renamed to `params`.

**Serialization/Deserialization:** Serialization and deserialization follow the same specifications already defined in [LIP 0028][lip-0028]; the resulting serialization is however different when the proposed transaction schema is used, due to the change of types for identifiers for module and command. For completeness we include the pseudocode [below](#serialization). The transaction ID is calculated in the same way as described in [LIP 0028][lip-0028] (the SHA-256 hash of the serialized transaction object).

**Signature Calculation:** The signature calculation function defined in [LIP 0028][lip-0028#signature-calculation] is updated to incorporate message tags introduced in [LIP 0037][lip-0037].

## Specification

The transaction schema defined in [LIP 0028][lip-0028] is superseded by the one defined [below](#json-schema).

The `params` property must follow the schema corresponding to the (`module`, `command`) pair defined in the corresponding module; we call this schema `paramsSchema`.

### JSON Schema

Transactions are serialized using `transactionSchema` given below.

```java
transactionSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "module",
        "command",
        "nonce",
        "fee",
        "senderPublicKey",
        "params",
        "signatures"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "module": {
            "dataType": "string",
            "minLength": MIN_MODULE_NAME_LENGTH,
            "maxLength": MAX_MODULE_NAME_LENGTH,
            "fieldNumber": 1
        },
        "command": {
            "dataType": "string",
            "minLength": MIN_COMMAND_NAME_LENGTH,
            "maxLength": MAX_COMMAND_NAME_LENGTH,
            "fieldNumber": 2
        },
        "nonce": {
            "dataType": "uint64",
            "fieldNumber": 3
        },
        "fee": {
            "dataType": "uint64",
            "fieldNumber": 4
        },
        "senderPublicKey": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "length": ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH,
            "fieldNumber": 5
        },
        "params": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 6
        },
        "signatures": {
            "dataType": "array",
            "items": {
                "dataType": "bytes",
                "length": ED25519_SIGNATURE_LENGTH
            },
            "fieldNumber": 7
        }
    }
}
```

#### Validation

For a transaction `trs` to be valid, it must satisfy the following:

* `trs` must follow the `transactionSchema`.
* `trs.params` is of length less than or equal to `MAX_PARAMS_SIZE`.
* `trs.module` is an alphanumeric string, i.e., matches the regular expression `"^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"`.
* `trs.command` is an alphanumeric string, i.e., matches the regular expression `"^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$"`.

The checks above are performed in the [static validation stage][lip-0055#block-processing] of the block processing.

Further, it is the responsibility of every module to check in the "Command Verification" hook of a command that the bytes in `trs.params` satisfy the parameter schema of the respective command. 

### Serialization

The serialization of an object of type `Transaction` is described in the following pseudocode.

```python
def encodeTransaction(trs: Transaction) -> bytes:
    return encode(transactionSchema, trs)
```

### Deserialization

Consider a binary message `trsMsg`, corresponding to a serialized transaction. The deserialization procedure is as follows:

```python
def decodeTransaction(trsMsg: bytes) -> Transaction:
    return decode(transactionSchema,trsMsg)
```

### Transaction Signature Calculation

The following function calculates the signature with secret key `sk` of a transaction `trs` for a chain identified by the given [chainID](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0037.md#chain-identifiers).

```python
def computeTransactionSignature(sk: PrivateKeyEd25519, trs: Transaction, chainID: bytes) -> SignatureEd25519:
    trs.signatures = []
    serializedTrs = encodeTransaction(trs)
    return signEd25519(sk, MESSAGE_TAG_TRANSACTION, chainID, serializedTrs)
```

By convention, the `signatures` property of the transaction object that is signed is required to be the empty array and therefore this property is set accordingly. Further note that the function `signEd25519` is defined in [LIP 0037](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0037.md#signing-and-verifying-with-ed25519).

### Transaction Signature Validation

Signature validation is done using the `verifySignatures` function defined in [LIP 0041](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0041.md#transaction-verification) with the input parameter `tag` equal to `MESSAGE_TAG_TRANSACTION`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP results in a hard fork as nodes following the proposed protocol will reject transactions following the previous schema, and nodes following the previous protocol will reject transactions following the proposed schema.

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Appendix

In this section, we present a serialization example for a token transfer transaction (defined in [LIP 0051][lip-0051#token-transfer]). To calculate the signature, we use the chain identifier: `chainID = 0x00000000` and the tag: `tag = "LSK_TX_".encode()`.
